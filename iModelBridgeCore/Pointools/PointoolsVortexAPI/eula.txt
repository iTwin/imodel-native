one copy of the Software for Production Use in the 
country where the Software is first obtained and (b) use 
the documentation that accompanies the Software for 
internal, non-commercial reference purposes only.
3.	RESERVED RIGHTS.   You acknowledge and agree 
that the Software is a proprietary product of Bentley or 
its suppliers, distributors and unrelated third parties 
("Suppliers") protected by copyright and other applicable 
intellectual property laws and treaty provisions. You 
further acknowledge and agree that the entire right, title 
and interest in and to the Software including associated 
intellectual property rights, shall remain with Bentley or

meaning) may not be sold, bartered or otherwise 
transferred.  Such Software may not be used for any 
purpose other than your testing or evaluation unless 
specified otherwise pursuant to a separate agreement 
signed by both you and Bentley.
11.	ACADEMIC SOFTWARE.  For Academic Software, 
Bentley hereby grants you a non-exclusive right and 
license to use in object code form such Academic 
Software for Academic Related Use only. You may not 
sell, barter or otherwise transfer Academic Software. 
Special Note Applicable to Academic Software:  If you 
have covered the Academic Software subject to this 
EULA pursuant to a valid BEN SELECT Agreement (or 
successor agreement) with Bentley then you may be 
entitled to additional and incremental licensing benefits 
to those set forth in this EULA by virtue of that 
relationship.  In the event that Academic Software is no 
longer covered by a valid BEN SELECT agreement due 
to termination of the BEN SELECT agreement or any 
other reason, then you will lose those incremental 
benefits, and your license rights will only be as set forth 
in this EULA.
12.	TIME CLOCKS. Bentley's default licensing term is 
perpetual unless otherwise specifically identified for the 
Software licensed. If you have licensed the Software 
subject to this EULA for a term shorter than a perpetual 
license, you acknowledge that the Software may be 
delivered to you with embedded Time Clocks. You agree 
that Time Clocks are not considered a defect of the 
Software and you release Bentley from any and all 
claims, however characterized, arising from or related to 
Time Clocks or their operation.
13.	TRANSFER.  Internal. You may transfer the Software 
and the EULA to a different Device at the same Site, 
provided you completely remove the Software from all 
prior Devices. You may also make a one-time transfer of 
a CAL to another of your Users or Devices located at the 
same Site.  In order to accomplish these transfers you 
may need to contact Bentley. External.  You may not 
transfer the Software and license granted under this 
EULA, or a CAL, to a third party without Bentley's prior 
written consent. If such consent is obtained, you may 
permanently transfer the Software and the license granted 
under this EULA, or the CAL, provided you transfer the 
Software and all and media to such third party, and you 
do not retain any copies. The recipient of such transfer 
must agree to all terms and conditions of the EULA. Any 
purported sublicense, assignment, transfer or 
encumbrance is void without Bentley's prior consent.
14.	UPGRADES.  You may not use any Software identified 
as an upgrade unless you are properly licensed to use 
Software which Bentley has identified as being eligible 
for an upgrade.  After installing an upgrade, you may use 
the original Software product that was eligible for an 
upgrade provided that at any one time you use only the 
upgraded Software or the prior Software version subject 
to the upgrade.  
15.	NO EXTENSION OF CAPABILITIES.  You may 
develop your own applications that interoperate or 
integrate with the Software.  Bentley prices its Software, 
among other factors, based on capabilities that we expose 
to you.  You may not extend the Software to enable or 
unlock capabilities of the Software not specifically 
identified by Bentley as forming part of the specified end 
user functionality.   
16.	SEPARATION OF COMPONENTS.  The Software is 
licensed as a single product. Component parts of the 
Software may not be separated and installed or used on 
multiple Devices.
17.	TERMINATION.  If you breach the terms and 
conditions of this EULA, Bentley may terminate this 
EULA without prejudicing any of its other rights.  In 
such event you must destroy and remove all copies of the 
Software from your Device(s).  Sections 1, 3, 13, 20, 21, 
23, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 specifically survive termination.
18.	NO AUTOMATED USE.  A license for the Software 
may not be shared or used concurrently on different 
Devices, nor to support multiple User or operational 
requests as indicated above.  As a result, you may not use 
the Software in an automated, unattended, non-
interactive server application or component (including 
ASP) where:  (i) multiple User requests from different 
Users are queued for processing; or (ii) multiple requests 
from one User are queued for processing but acting 
against content created or edited by other Users.  
Examples which would violate this Section 18 include 
but are not limited to use as a plot server, file translator, 
print server or other applications using or employing 
similar methods.  
19.	LIMITED WARRANTY.   Except for Software which 
is identified as no-charge, free, demo, evaluation, BDN, 
Beta or NFR, which is provided to you "AS-IS" and 
specifically without warranty of any kind, for sixty (60) 
days from the date of first installation (the "Warranty 
Period"), Bentley warrants that (i) the Software will 
perform substantially in accordance with the functional 
specifications in the documentation which accompanies 
the Software; and (ii) the media on which the Software is 
distributed meets generally accepted industry standards. 
It is understood that neither Bentley nor its Suppliers are 
responsible for your use of the Software or the results

hardware or software may prevent you from gaining 
access to the Software. This limited warranty is offered 
by Bentley alone, and is not extended to any software 
code that may be contributed to the Software by our 
Suppliers. Any supplements or updates to the Software 
(including but not limited to fixes, work in progress 
builds, or subsequent updates) provided to you after the 
expiration of the Limited Warranty period above are not 
covered by any warranty or condition, express, implied or 
statutory.
20.	DISCLAIMER.  THE FOREGOING LIMITED 
WARRANTY STATES THE SOLE AND 
EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES FOR BENTLEY'S OR ITS 
SUPPLIER'S BREACH OF WARRANTY.  EXCEPT 
FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY AND TO THE 
MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW, BENTLEY AND ITS 
SUPPLIERS PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE AS IS AND 
WITH ALL FAULTS, AND TO THE MAXIMUM 
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN 
YOUR JURISDICTION, BENTLEY AND ITS 
SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL OTHER 
WARRANTIES, FOR ITSELF AND FOR ALL 
SUPPLIERS, EITHER STATUTORY, EXPRESSED 
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF GOOD TITLE, 
WARRANTIES AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, AND 
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THIS LIMITED 
WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC RIGHTS; YOU 
MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS, WHICH VARY 
AMONG JURISDICTIONS.
21.	HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES. The Software is not fault 
tolerant and is not designed, manufactured or intended 
for use or resale as control equipment in hazardous 
environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in 
the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or 
communication systems, air traffic control, direct life 
support machines, or weapons systems, in which the 
failure of the Software could lead directly to death, 
personal injury, or severe physical or environmental 
damage ("High Risk Activities"). Accordingly, Bentley 
and its Suppliers specifically disclaim any express or 
implied warranty of fitness for High Risk Activities. 
22.	END USER REMEDIES.  If a defect in the Software 
appears that constitutes a breach of the above Limited 
Warranty, Bentley shall, at its sole option, repair the 
Software, refund the price you paid for the Software or 
replace the defective item(s), provided that: (i) you notify 
Bentley of the defect during the Warranty Period; (ii) the 
Software is not modified, changed, or altered by anyone 
other than Bentley, unless authorized by Bentley in 
writing; (iii) your computer equipment is in good 
operating order and the Software is installed in an 
officially supported environment; and (iv) the non-
conformity is not caused by a third party or by you, your 
agents, employees or contractors. Repaired, corrected, or 
replaced Software shall be covered by this limited 
warranty for the period remaining under the warranty 
covered by the original Software, or if longer, for thirty 
(30) days after the date: (a) of installation by you of the 
repaired or replaced Software, or (b) Bentley advised you 
how to operate the Software so as to achieve the 
functionality described in the documentation. YOU 
AGREE THAT THE FOREGOING CONSTITUTES 
YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR 
BREACH BY BENTLEY OF THE LIMITED 
WARRANTY MADE IN THIS EULA. 
23.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Regardless of whether 
any remedy set forth herein fails of its essential purpose 
by law, in no event will Bentley or its Suppliers be liable 
for indirect, special, incidental, economic or consequential 
damages, regardless of the nature of the claim, including 
without limitation lost profits, costs of delay, interruption 
of business, loss of use, costs of lost or damaged data or 
documentation or liabilities to third parties arising from 
any source, even if Bentley has been advised of the 
possibility of such damages. In no event shall the liability 
of Bentley or its Suppliers exceed the amount paid by 
you (in the currency used to purchase) for the Software. 
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or 
limitation of implied warranties or limitation of liability 
for incidental or consequential damages, so the above 
limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.  THE 
PROVISIONS OF THIS EULA ALLOCATE THE 
RISKS BETWEEN BENTLEY AND YOU. 
BENTLEY'S PRICING REFLECTS THIS 
ALLOCATION OF RISK AND THE LIMITATION 
OF LIABILITY SPECIFIED HEREIN.  
24.	STATUTORY CONSUMER RIGHTS.  Nothing in 
this EULA is meant to contravene statutory rights that 
consumers may have pursuant to local law.  
25.	EXPORT CONTROLS.  The Software is subject to 
U.S. export control laws, regulations and requirements, in 
addition to export control laws, regulations and 
requirements of other agencies or authorities based 
outside of the United States (collectively referred to as 
"Export Controls"). Regardless of any disclosure made 
by you to Bentley of an ultimate destination of the 
Software, you must not export, re-export or transfer, 
whether directly or indirectly, the Software, or any 
portion thereof, or any system containing such Software

Section 2: Terms Applicable to Server Software

This section details the installation, use and licensing of 
Server Software and associated CALs as well as External 
Connector licenses.
1.	CERTAIN ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS.
1.1.	"Client Software" means software that allows a 
Device to access or utilize Server Software (and, also 
where applicable to utilize certain aspects of the 
Software when disconnected from the Server).
1.2.	"External Connector" means a separately licensable 
module for specific Server Software which 
authorizes use of the Server Software by External 
Users.
1.3.	"Per Processor" is a Server Software licensing 
mode where you are licensed to utilize the Server 
Software on one or more physical or virtual 
processors within a designated Server.
1.4.	"Per Server" is a Server Software licensing mode 
where you are licensed to utilize the Server Software 
on all processors physically contained within the 
designated Server.
1.5.	"Per User" or "Per Device" are licensing modes 
that require you to license a separate CAL for each 
unique User or Device respectively that accesses or 
utilizes the Server Software.
1.6.	"Server" means any one of your computers that can 
run Server Software.
1.7.	"Server Software" means Software that provides 
services or functionality to your Server(s).
1.8.	"Server/CAL" is a licensing mode where the 
maximum number of Users (or Devices, if applicable) 
which may access or utilize the Server Software at a 
given interval is less than or equal to the number of 
CALs that you have acquired and designated for use 
exclusively with that Server Software.
2.	LICENSING MODES.  
2.1.	Servers.  Bentley licenses Server Software on a 
Server/CAL basis with either Device or User CALs 
and/or on a Per Processor basis.  Some Server 
Software may be eligible for External Connector 
licensing.  Server Software may be limited, even in 
Server/CAL licensing mode, as to the total number 
of Devices and/or Users that may access a 
designated Server Product.  Unless explicitly 
specified in the documentation accompanying the 
Server Software, the default licensing mode for all 
Server Software is Server/CAL with User CALs.  
2.2.	CALs.  CALs are licensed by Bentley on a per 
Server, per Device or per User basis.  A User CAL 
permits one User (using any Device) to access or use 
the Server Software.  A Device CAL permits one 
Device to access or use the Server Software.  Special 
Note Applicable to CAL Licensing:  If you have 
covered the CALs and Server Software subject to 
this EULA pursuant to a valid SELECT Agreement 
with Bentley then you may be entitled to additional 
and incremental licensing benefits to those set forth 
in this EULA by virtue of that relationship.  In the 
event your SELECT Agreement with Bentley 
terminates or you otherwise elect to remove CALs 
and/or their associated Server Software from 
coverage pursuant to a SELECT Agreement with 
Bentley then you will lose those incremental benefits, 
and your license rights will only be as set forth in this 
EULA. 
2.3.	External Connectors.  Certain Server Products may 
be licensed to support External Users by virtue of an 
External Connector license.
3.	GRANT OF LICENSE FOR SOFTWARE IN 
SERVER/CAL MODE.  As and for so long as you 
comply with all of the terms of this EULA, Bentley 
grants you the following rights:
3.1.	Installation and Use.  
(a)	Server Software.  You may install and use one 
copy of the Server Software for Production Use 
on a single Server in the country where the 
Server Software was first obtained. You may 
also use the documentation that accompanies the 
Server Software for internal, non-commercial 
reference purposes only.
(b)	Client Software. You may install and use the 
Client Software on the aggregate total number 
of Devices to which you have dedicated a CAL 
for such usage.  
(c)	CALs.  A separate CAL is required for each 
User or Device that accesses or uses Server 
Software on any of your Servers.  A CAL grants 
a User (using any Device) or a Device the right 
to access or otherwise utilize the Server 
Software you have deployed on your Server.  
The maximum number of Users or Devices that 
may access or use Server Software installed on a 
particular Server at a given interval equals the 
number of CALs (of either type) that you 
acquire and designate for use exclusively with 
that Server.  CALs cannot be pooled among 
internal Users or Devices and are tied to one 
Server Software installation.  
(d)	Passive Fail-Over Server.  If the Server 
Software is used in a clustered environment, you 
may use the Server Software on a temporary 
basis on a Server that is employed only and 
exclusively for fail-over support.
4.	GRANT OF LICENSE FOR SERVER SOFTWARE 
IN PER SERVER MODE.  As and for so long as you 
comply with all of the terms of this EULA, Bentley 
grants you the following rights:
4.1.	Installation and Use
(a)	Server Software.  You may install and use one 
copy of the Server Software for Production Use 
on a single Server in the country where the 
Server Software was first obtained.  You may 
also use the documentation that accompanies the 
Server Software for internal, non-commercial 
reference purposes only.  In Per Server licensing 
mode, the Bentley default is that you may use 
the Server Software on all processors physically 
contained within that one Server.  If the Server 
Software is licensed in Per Processor mode, you 
may only use the Software on the authorized 
and licensed number of processors (physical or 
virtual) within that Server. 
(b)	Client Software.  In Per Server licensing mode, 
unless Bentley licenses the Server Software with 
a limitation on the maximum number of Devices 
or Users that may access it, you may install the 
Client Software on any Device in support of any 
number of Users so long as the Client Software 
is being used only in conjunction with the Server 
Software.
(c)	CALs.  In Per Server licensing mode, unless 
Bentley licenses the Server Software with a 
limitation on the maximum number of Users or 
Devices that may access it, an unlimited number 
of Users or Devices may access and use the 
Server Software.  CALs are not required for 
individual Users or Devices in the Per Server 
licensing mode.
(d)	Passive Fail-Over Server.  If the Server 
Software is used in a clustered environment, you 
may use the Server Software on a temporary 
basis on a Server that is employed only and 
exclusively for fail-over support.
5.	GRANT OF LICENSE FOR EXTERNAL 
CONNECTOR LICENSES.  As and for so long as you 
comply with all of the terms of this EULA, Bentley 
grants you the following rights:
5.1.	Installation and Use
(a)	External Connector License.  You may install 
and use one copy of the External Connector on 
one Device and connect that Device to the 
designated Server Software whether or not 
located at the same Site, but always within the 
same country as the Server Software installation. 
(b)	External Users.  The default licensing mode for 
an External Connector authorizes you, for each 
External Connector license that you acquire, to 
permit any number of External Users to access 
or use a single copy of the designated Server 
Software for which the External Connector 
License has been obtained without the need for 
you to acquire a CAL for each External User.  If 
any User does not clearly qualify as an External 
User then you will need to properly license such 
use and access by the User of the Server 
Software by a method other than via the 
External Connector.  Certain External Connector 
licenses only authorize a limited number of 
External Users to connect via that External 
Connector, please check your Product 
documentation and License Key for specific 
details, limitations and qualifications.
(c)	Passive Fail-Over External Connector.  If the 
External Connector is installed on a Device used 
in a clustered environment, you may use the 
External Connector on a temporary basis on a 
Server or Device that is employed only and 
exclusively for fail-over support.
