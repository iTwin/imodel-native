Notice that some of these can refer to a single file (jpg, tif for example) while others hint to the existence of many structured interrelated documents (3SM, 3MX,...). Note also that the file format does not necessariy imply the Classification of the RealityData. A TIF file can store Imagery (a raster), Terrain (DEM file which is a TIF with a numeric pixel type), Pinned (A scan from a textual document). -->

The string is easily interpreted for rasters but less so for pointclouds that could interpret the values as mean distance between samples. -->
