An orthoimage is a uniform-scale image where corrections have been made for feature displacement such as building tilt and for scale variations caused by terrain relief, sensor geometry, and camera tilt. A mathematical equation based on ground control points, sensor calibration information, and a digital elevation model is applied to each pixel to rectify the image to obtain the geometric qualities of a map. A digital orthoimage may be created from several photographs mosaicked to form the final image. The source imagery may be black-and-white, natural color, color infrared, or color near infrared (4-band) with a pixel resolution of 1-meter or finer. With orthoimagery, the resolution refers to the distance on the ground represented by each pixel. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. Data received at EROS were reprojected from source projection to a standard utm projection and resolution resampled to align to the U.S. National Grid (USNG) using The National Map. The naming convention is based on the USNG, taking the coordinates of the SW corner of the orthoimage. The metadata were imported and updated for display through The National Map at http://nationalmap.gov/viewer.html Image-level metadata are provided in XML format. Data were compressed utilizing IAS software. The compression was JPEG2000 Lossy Compressed. The file format created was .jp2.","citation":"U.S. Geological Survey, USGS High Resolution Orthoimagery for Branch County, MI: 16TFM735530 200404 0x6000m BW 1: U.S. Geological Survey.","purpose":"A digital orthoimage is a geometrically accurate photographic record of landscape conditions at the time of the corresponding aerial photography. As such, High Resolution Orthoimagery is useful for a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring, facility engineering/maintenance, city/county planning, property line review, etc. The digital orthoimage can be used alone or as a raster basemap for corresponding vector line mapping. The detailed focus of High Resolution Orthoimagery provides emergency responders critical information in determining the best evacuation routes, alternative routes and safe access to aid. High Resolution Orthoimagery assists law enforcement personnel in determining the best locations to place surveillance cameras in high-traffic urban areas and popular attractions. The data assists Federal, State and local emergency responders in planning for homeland security efforts. This data also supports The National Map.","provenance":{"html":"Added to Sciencebase on Sun Jun 07 22:37:57 MDT 2015 by processing URL \n<b>16TFM735530_200404_0x6000m_BW_1.xml<\u002fb> in item \n<a
