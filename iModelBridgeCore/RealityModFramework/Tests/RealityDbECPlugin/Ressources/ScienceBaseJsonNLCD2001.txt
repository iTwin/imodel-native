The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land Cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. This land cover map and all documents pertaining to it are considered \"provisional\" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2004) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp. The NLCD 2001 is created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. This update represents a seamless assembly of updated NLCD 2001 Land Cover (2011 Edition) for all 66 MRLC mapping zones. Questions about the NLCD the NLCD 2001 Land Cover 2011 Edition can be directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.","citation":"U.S. Geological Survey, 20141010, NLCD 2001 Land Cover (2011 Edition, amended 2014), by State: NLCD2001_LC_Arizona: U.S. Geological Survey.","purpose":"The goal of this project is to provide the Nation with complete, current and consistent public domain information on its land use and land cover.","provenance":{"html":"Added to Sciencebase on Sat Feb 11 23:01:56 MST 2017 by processing URL <b>NLCD2001_LC_Arizona.xml<\u002fb> in item <a href=\"https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/4f70a45ee4b058caae3f8db9\">https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/4f70a45ee4b058caae3f8db9<\u002fa><br>","dataSource":"Link Processing","linkProcess":{"itemReference":"4f70a45ee4b058caae3f8db9","linkReference":"https://thor-f5.er.usgs.gov/ngtoc/metadata/waf/land_cover/2001/geotiff/NLCD2001_LC_Arizona.xml","dateProcessed":"2017-02-12T06:01:56Z","processedBy":"wgillman@usgs.gov","processType":"WebAccessibleFolder"},"dateCreated":"2017-02-12T06:02:12Z","lastUpdated":"2017-02-12T06:02:14Z"},"maintenanceUpdateFrequency":"Every 5 years","hasChildren":false,"parentId":"4f70a45ee4b058caae3f8db9","contacts":[{"name":"U.S. Geological Survey","type":"Point of Contact","contactType":"organization","ttyPhone":"605/594-6933","hours":"0800 - 1600 CT, M - F (-6h CST/-5h CDT GMT)","instructions":"The USGS point of contact is for questions relating to the data display and download from this web site.
