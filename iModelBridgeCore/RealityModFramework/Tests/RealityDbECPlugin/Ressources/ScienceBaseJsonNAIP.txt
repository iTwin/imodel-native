The NAIP program is administered by USDA FSA and has been established to support two main FSA strategic goals centered on agricultural production. These are, increase stewardship of America's natural resources while enhancing the environment, and to ensure commodities are procured and distributed effectively and efficiently to increase food security.

The NAIP program is administered by USDA FSA and has been established to support two main FSA strategic goals centered on agricultural production. These are, increase stewardship of America's natural resources while enhancing the environment, and to ensure commodities are procured and distributed effectively and efficiently to increase food security. The NAIP program supports these goals by acquiring and providing ortho imagery that has been collected during the agricultural growing season in the U.S. The NAIP ortho imagery is tailored to meet FSA requirements and is a fundamental tool used to support FSA farm and conservation programs. Ortho imagery provides an effective, intuitive means of communication about farm program administration between FSA and stakeholders. New technology and innovation is identified by fostering and maintaining a relationship with vendors and government partners, and by keeping pace with the broader geospatial community. As a result of these efforts the NAIP program provides three main products: DOQQ tiles, Compressed County Mosaics (CCM), and Seamline shape files The Contract specifications for NAIP imagery have changed over time reflecting agency requirements and improving technologies. These changes include image resolution, horizontal accuracy, coverage area, and number of bands. In general, flying seasons are established by FSA and are targeted for peak crop growing conditions. The NAIP acquisition cycle is based on a minimum 3 year refresh of base ortho imagery. The tiling format of the NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 pixel buffer on all four sides. NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983. NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.","citation":"USDA-FSA-APFO Aerial Photography Field Office, 20151006, FSA 10:1 NAIP Imagery m_3309603_ne_14_1_20150607_20150817 3.75 x 3.75 minute JPEG2000 from The National Map: USDA-FSA-APFO Aerial Photography Field Office.","purpose":"NAIP imagery is available for distribution within 60 days of the end of a flying season and is intended to provide current information of agricultural conditions in support of USDA farm programs. For USDA Farm Service Agency, the 1 meter and 1/2 meter GSD product provides an ortho image base for Common Land Unit boundaries and other data sets. The 1 meter and 1/2 meter NAIP imagery is generally acquired in projects covering full states in cooperation with state government and other federal agencies that use the imagery for a variety of purposes including land use planning and natural resource assessment. The NAIP is also used for disaster response. While suitable for a variety of uses, prior to 2007 the 2 meter GSD NAIP imagery was primarily intended to assess \"crop condition and compliance\" to USDA farm program conditions. The 2 meter imagery was generally acquired only for agricultural areas within state projects.","provenance":{"html":"Added to Sciencebase on Sun Nov 13 02:37:37 MST 2016 by processing URL
