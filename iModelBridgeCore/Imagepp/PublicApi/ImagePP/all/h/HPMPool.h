|
|   This class is used to define "object pools".  The pool will manage
|   a set of objects (pool items) according to imposed limitations. These
|   limitations could be based upon the number of items of the amount of 
|   memory allowed. 
|   The pool will advice pool items if these have not been recently used 
|   and the limtations have been reached so these items can be discarded.
|   The discarding proper is not the responsibility of the pool proper
|   but instead is performed after a request to the pool item. The actual
|   way these items are discarded is unknow to the pool but a 
|   typical way is for pool items to be persisted upon a storage.
|   Notice that the HPM class set provides HPMObjectStore amd 
|   HPMLoader which may be used 
|   by implementations of pool items. These loaders will interact with 
|   the pool if required.
|   Together with
|   HPMObjectStore, these classes may implement a system of automatic memory
|   management where objects that share limited memory or count resources may be
|   swapped to another storage media (i.e. database or file) when they are
|   not used.  In this mechanism, an instance of HPMPool has the
|   responsibility to:
|
|   @list{know which objects are in physical memory, not swapped to an
|         object store;}
|
|   @list{determine when objects need to be swapped and which objects
|         will be.}
|
|   @end
|
|   A pool is informed of every use of all items that are associated to
|   it. In return, the pool requests for discards (swaps to a store or whatever 
|   the pool item performs in order to discard) objects when
|   required.  This way, a HPMPool instance may be considered as managing a
|   pool of memory that is shared by many objects.
|
|   This present class is a functional one.  Its implementation uses a smart MRU
|   list to help keep in memory objects recently and frequently used while
|   allowing more "sleepy" objects to be discarded when needed.
|   This class may be easily derived to implement a different algorithm.
|
|   NOTE: The pool will always allow one object whatever the size limit, even if the
|   pool size is smaller than the size of the object.

    | Memory management
    | Although the memory manager of the pool is owned by the pool proper, it is usally 
    | for the pool item to request that memory be allocated. 
    | DESIGN differences. At the moment there is a significant difference between the
    | present pool and the Count limited pool that was implemented aside the present
    | pool. The intent is to merge both designs. 
    | The present pool provides a simple repeat of the memory manager interface:
    |  AllocMemory
    |  FreeMemory
    |  NeedMemory
    | The later is only needed by a specific export intended memory manager.
    |
    | Old design interface:
    |   Pool:
    |     ChangeLimit                - Unused
    |     GetLimit                   - Unused
    |     GetActualCount             - Unused
    |     NotifyAccess               - Used by HPMPoolItem::NotifyPool only
    |     RemoveItem                 - Used by HPMPoolItem::MoveToPool to change pool and HPMPoolItem::RemoveFromPool and HPMPoolItem::Discard
    |     AllocMemory                - Used by HRABitmap only
    |     NeedMemory                 - Used by HRATiledRaster only
    |     FreeMemory                 - Used by HRABitmap only
    |     IsMemoryMgrEnabled         - Used by HRABitmap only
    |
    |   PoolItem (NOTE: Only HRATiledRaster and HIMBufferedImage are pool items)
    |     Discard                    - Used by HIMBufferedImage and HRATiledRaster
    |     MoveToPool                 - Used by HIMBlendCorridor and HIMBufferedImage only
    |     RemoveFromPool             - Unused (The HPMMemoryMgrExport performs the removal all the time)
    |     NotifyPool                 - Used by HRAPyramidRaster only (upon individual tiles)
    |     GetPool                    - Used by HRABitmap, HPS*(?), HPMObjectStore(?)
    |     HasInPool                  - Used by HRAPyramidRaster
    |
    |
    | The other design is different.
    | Upon Allocate, the pool item is provided. The pool will handshake with the pool item
    | to add the item to the pool and allocate memory then provide it to the
    | item.
    | Reallocate can be used. In that case the memcpy will be performed to the new location.
    | Again Free is used to at the same time remove the item from the pool and release the memory.
    | if the item is pinned into memory then memory deallocation is suspended but the item is removed from
    | pool management using RemoveItem. Then when memory can be freed at last, the call to FreeRemovedItemMemory
    | is performed.
    | NOTE: What happens if item is removed without free and pool is destroyed. In that case
    | memory that should normaly be under control of the memory manager of the pool
    | will be stuck in memory. ????? Should the pool request immediate freeing of such item?
    |
    | New Design interface in brief:
    |   Pool:
    |     Allocate                   = AllocMemory
    |     Reallocate                 TO BE ADDED
    |     Free                       = FreeMemory
    |     NotifyAccess               = NotifyAccess
    |     FreeRemovedItemMemory      To BE ADDED
    |     RemoveItem                 = RemoveItem
    |     ChangeLimit                = ChangeLimit
    |     GetLimit                   = GetLimit
    |     GetActualCount             = GetActualCount
    | 
    | This design only works because the pool item has the following
    | interface:
    |
    |   PoolItem: 
    |       member: pool
    |       SetPool                      = MoveToPool / RemoveFromPool
    |       GetPool                      = GetPool
    |       IsDirty                      TO ADD!
    |       SetDirty                     TO ADD!
    |       Discard                      = Discard
    |       Discarded                    TO ADD!
    |       Inflate                      Reverse of Discard. Allows an eventual management system to discard/inflate according to some mechanism
    |       GetPoolManaged               = HasInPool (?)
    |     Protected:
    |       Pin
    |       Pinned
    |       Unpin
    |       SetDiscarded

|struct HPMPoolItem
| Ancester class for items that must be managed by a pool. 
| IMPORTANT NOTE: The Discard can be called by the pool when the item has already 
| been removed from the pool list. This enables the discard operation to use the pool in
| the discard process. This is for example essential for classes such as pyramid raster 
| for which the discard may trigger the update of the sub-resolution which in turn require
| new pool managed memory. To prevent running conditions the pool item is first 
| removed from pool management and then the discard is called. This implies that during the discard 
| process the pool item may not be pool managed yet the pool must be called in order
| to complete memory deallocation.
| The class will inherit from this Pool Item and implement
| the appropriate Discard() function. The Discard() implementation MUST call the pool Free() method
| to deallocate its memory otherwise the pool memory management administration will be incorrect.
| A pool item cannot refuse to discard. If for some reason, the memory allocated cannot be
| released, then the pool item may call RemoveFromManagement() method. This pool method will remove the
| memory of the item from management without deallocating it. In such case the pool item is responsible
| of releasing the memory used by itself
|
| The memory will always be allocated by the pool and set internally in the Pool Item through the
| SetMemory() function only available to the Pool (through friendship)
|
| NOTE: In order to fucntion properly, the pool must be advised whenever a pool item is accessed
| Thus a call to NotifyAccess() method of the pool should be performed.

/**

    This class is used to maximize reuse of big blocks typically
    to prevent fragmentation of the memory space.

    This memory manager will allocate blocks upon the heap yet not release
    them immediately. It will instead keep these allocated memory chunks
    for a future request of memory. Any request for memory will return the smallest
    chunk of free memory that contains at least the requested size.
    If the requested memory is greater than any free chunks then a new chunk
    will be allocated. If a new memory chunk is allocated then some sort of
    chunk releasal will be performed. If there are too many chunks of
    allocated free memory then the smallest of them will be released.

    The purpose of this memory manager is simply to minimise the chances
    of memory heap fragmentation which may result in effective memory
    exhaustion when large chunks of memroy are iteratively allocated/deallocated at the
    same time smaller portions of memory are allocated/deallocated on the same heap.

    Since the present manager also uses the normal heap, the large memory chunks will still
    make use of the same memory space but the manager will minimize the allocate/deallocate
    events upon managed memory blocks thus diminishing fragmentation.

    The present manager is not meant to manage small portions of memory!!
