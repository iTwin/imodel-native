/**----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Returns a constant reference to a string that contains the search
 expression included in this URL.  The search expression is an expression
 understood by the ECWP server, that is embedded in the "url-path"
 section of the URL; this means that calling @k{GetURLPath} returns the
 combination of the path and the search part, to get only the path the
 method @k{GetPath} should be called.

 @return A constant reference to the string that contains the search
         expression that was added to the path in this URL.  It does not
         begin by the question mark used as separator.  May be empty if
         there is no search expression or no path in this URL.
