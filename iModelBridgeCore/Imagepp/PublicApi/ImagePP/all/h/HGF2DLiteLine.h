    This class implements a line. This is a quite simple class defining a line infinite in both directions.
    The line can be defined in many ways. Either by a position and a bearing, two points, or mathematical
    parameters of the line equation (Slope and Intercept). The class implements methods to perform some
    mathematical operations upon lines and location (HGF2DPosition). Such operations include finding
    a crossing point between lines, and ways to obtains the closest point on line from a specified
    location. A line does not have a specific direction. For this reason two bearings can be used
    when defining a line by bearing. It follows that two bearing could be returned by the
    CalculateBearing method. Either one would be valid.

    The equation of a line is :

    y = Mx + B

    where :
    M is the slope
    B is the intercept with the Y axis.

    If the slope M is infinity (the line is vertical), then the equation reduces to :

    where G is then the intercept with the X axis.

    Due to its nature, the line will sometimes refuse to interact with other lines, if the coordinate
    systems between these lines is different and not related through a transformation which preserves
    linearity. If a transformation model did not preserve linearity was accepted, then the line,
    when transformed in the other coordinate system, would result in an
    infinite size object which would not be a line.

    The class is coded to maximize precision. This includes the internal representation of lines in
    the inverse form when the slope becomes too high

    x = Ny + C
    where:
    N is the invert slope
    C in the intercept with the X axis.

    Externally to the class however, the line is always available in the first form.
