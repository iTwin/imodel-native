 This is the constructor for this class.  At this generic level, the
 constructor only establish a link between the store and a "default
 object pool".  This link is mandatory and is used by automatic loaders
 when they are initialized while not assigned to a specific pool:
 the default pool of the store used by a loader will be chosen by
 that loader for its memory management duties. See the documentation of
 HPMLoader to know more about automatic memory management.

 There is a global default log, that defines infinite memory space (so it
 does not cause object discarding) that can be used here, by taking its
 address:  @c{&g_DefaultPool}.

 @param pi_pDefaultPool Pointer to the pool that will be considered as the
                        @t{default pool} for loaders refering to objects
                        that persist in this store.

 @inheritance Must be called by child classes.  Usually the constructor
              of a child class will require a pointer to the default pool
              to be provided by class user and will be passed to this
              constructor. The destructor of each class that inherits
              from this one must call @k{CleanUp}.

 modification flag set to false (see @k{ToBeSaved}) are not saved.

/**----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This method "saves" the specified object in this store.

 The behavior will depend on the actual relation between this store and
 the object to save. If the object is already attached to this store,
 meaning that there is data for this object in the store, data will be
 updated with the data found in the specified object.  If no link exists
 at that time, an object entry will be created in the store, data will be
 saved in that entry and the store will establish the link between itself
 and the object (by attaching the object to itself and giving it an
 object ID).

 A simpler way is to call the method @k{SaveOn} or the method @k{Save} on the
 persistent object, which uses the method @k{Save} internally.

 If the object is already present in the store, it must not be locked in
 any way except by this manager.  If locked, the execution of the program
 is paused until the lock is removed.

 @param pi_pObj Pointer to object to save

 @inheritance This pure virtual method must be overriden for each store
              implementation.  If the object store supports only a
              limited range of classes, the implementation should ask the
              class key of the object to save and perform saving
              specifically for that kind of object.  If the store support
              all classes of persistent objects, the implementation will
              need to use the class dictionary for the object to save.

              If the object gets an ID for the first time (it wasn't
              persistent before), it must be linked to this store by
              calling its @k{SetStore} method, dentified by using
              @k{SetID}, then registered in the list of loaded objects by
              calling @k{RegisterObject}.

              If the object is already present in the store, and the
              manager doesn't own a lock for it, the object must be
              temporarily locked for the duration of writing.  This
              prevent unwanted effects on eventual concurrent loading
              that may occur from another thread or process.
