/*! @brief Forwards inbound URLs for iOS 8.x and below to @c application:openURL:options:.
 @discussion When you drop support for versions of iOS earlier than 9.0, you can delete this
 method. NB. this implementation doesn't forward the sourceApplication or annotations. If you
 need these, then you may want @c application:openURL:options to call this method instead.
