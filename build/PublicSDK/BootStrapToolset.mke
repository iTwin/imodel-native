%include mdl.mki

# This mke file is run by the special, unique "ToolsetPart". It's only job is to let mdl.mki include DefaultToolSet.mki and ApplyToolSet.mki, 
# which do some one-time bootstrapping work (e.g., by calling vcvars.bat and then capturing the result in $(OutRoot)$(TARGET_PROCESSOR_DIRECTORY)/ToolSetEnv.mki
# the first time they are called. This setup work must be done only once and before any part the uses the compiler can run. It is done by the 
# special ToolsetPart, to make that happen.
