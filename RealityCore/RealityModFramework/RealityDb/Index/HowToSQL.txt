How to generate the sql script used to generate the RMIndex database table structure from an existing database:

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect the server. This was done with the 2012 version.
2. Expand the Databases node, right-click "RMIndex" (or whatever it is called), hover "Tasks", then click "Generate Scripts".
3. At the "Choose Objects" step, select "Script entire database and all database objects"
4. At the "Set Scripting Options", select "Save scripts to a specific location". Select "Save to file", "Single file" and "Save as Unicode text". You can change the name of the generated file if you want.
   Click on the "Advanced" button. Under "General", ensure that "Types of data to script" is set to Schema only. It has not been yet tested for data.
5. Save your script.

How to use your script to generate the database :

You may want to change the location of the files generated by the script by opening the script file and changing the values of the two FILENAME strings. 
You may also replace all of the RMIndex in the file by the name you wish the database to have.
Open a command line window and enter the following command: 
	“>sqlcmd –S [Your sql server instance name] –i [location of the  sql script on your computer]“
The database should now exist.
