    The nature of all descending vector types enables the class to recognize
    certain caracteristics. Vectors, whatever their type, are constructed of
    linear elements located in a 2D coordinate system. All the vector types
    therefore possess a set of lines in space that can be interpreted differently
    upon their nature. This line or lines can be paths into space, boundaries of
    areas, graphical representation support etc.

    Each of these interpretation lines is assigned a direction applicable for
    all points of the line. These arbitrary directions are called ALPHA and BETA.
    The ALPHA direction is either one of the directions on the lines for a
    specified point, and BETA is by definition, the other direction. These
    directions must be consistent. If for some point, another given point
    is located in the ALPHA direction, therefore, the first point is located in
    the BETA direction of the second. The definition of the ALPHA and BETA
    direction is therefore fixed and cannot change along the constituting line
    of the vectors.


    The vector class also recognizes the optional ability of constituting lines
    to have extremities to their definition. Some line may have no extremities,
    as will be the case in shape elements, but some may have.

    The properties and behavior common to all vectors is thoroughly explained
    in the "HMR Vector Handbook". Please refer to this document for the
    details of vector implementation.
