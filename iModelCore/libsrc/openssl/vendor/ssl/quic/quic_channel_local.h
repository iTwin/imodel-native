 * QUIC_CHANNEL structure, it can be viewed as an extention of the QUIC_CHANNEL
 * implementation. While the RX depacketiser could be provided with adequate
 * accessors to do what it needs, this would weaken the abstraction provided by
 * the QUIC_CHANNEL to other components; moreover the coupling of the RX
 * depacketiser to QUIC_CHANNEL internals is too deep and bespoke to make this
 * desirable.
