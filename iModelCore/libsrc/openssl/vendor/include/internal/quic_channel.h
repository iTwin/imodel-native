/*
 * QUIC Channel
 * ============
 *
 * A QUIC channel (QUIC_CHANNEL) is an object which binds together all of the
 * various pieces of QUIC into a single top-level object, and handles connection
 * state which is not specific to the client or server roles. In particular, it
 * is strictly separated from the libssl front end I/O API personality layer,
 * and is not an SSL object.
 *
 * The name QUIC_CHANNEL is chosen because QUIC_CONNECTION is already in use,
 * but functionally these relate to the same thing (a QUIC connection). The use
 * of two separate objects ensures clean separation between the API personality
 * layer and common code for handling connections, and between the functionality
 * which is specific to clients and which is specific to servers, and the
 * functionality which is common to both.
 *
 * The API personality layer provides SSL objects (e.g. a QUIC_CONNECTION) which
 * consume a QUIC channel and implement a specific public API. Things which are
 * handled by the API personality layer include emulation of blocking semantics,
 * handling of SSL object mode flags like non-partial write mode, etc.
 *
 * Where the QUIC_CHANNEL is used in a server role, there is one QUIC_CHANNEL
 * per connection. In the future a QUIC Channel Manager will probably be defined
 * to handle ownership of resources which are shared between connections (e.g.
 * demuxers). Since we only use server-side functionality for dummy test servers
 * for now, which only need to handle one connection at a time, this is not
 * currently modelled.
