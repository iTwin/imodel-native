 * QUIC Test Server Module
 * =======================
 *
 * This implements a QUIC test server. Since full QUIC server support is not yet
 * implemented this server is limited in features and scope. It exists to
 * provide a target for our QUIC client to talk to for testing purposes.
 *
 * A given QUIC test server instance supports only one client at a time.
 *
 * Note that this test server is not suitable for production use because it does
 * not implement address verification, anti-amplification or retry logic.
