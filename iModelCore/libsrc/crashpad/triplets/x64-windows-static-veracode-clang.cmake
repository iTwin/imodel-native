# LLVM clang-cl via the shared chainload toolchain (../../windows-clang-cl.toolchain.cmake) so
# the clang (WINDOWS_CLANG) toolset gets its own vcpkg ABI hash, separate from the MSVC build.

# Setting VCPKG_CHAINLOAD_TOOLCHAIN_FILE disables vcpkg's automatic Visual Studio (vcvars)
# environment setup; re-enable it so clang-cl still gets the MSVC SDK headers and CRT import
# libraries (INCLUDE/LIB). Without it, vcpkg's compiler detection fails ("unable to detect the
# active compiler's information").

# Veracode: no runtime checks (and clang-cl has none regardless).
