#       Each line represents a coordinate conversion
#       test.  The first three and the second three
#       elements represent a location.  The first
#       element of each location is the coordinate
#       system name.  The second is the X coordinate
#       or longitude, the third element is the Y
#       coordinate or latitude.
#
#       Each test consists of converting the first
#       location to the coordinate system of the
#       second and comparing the results.  The last
#       two elements are the X and Y tolerance of
#       the comparison.
#
#       Each test is based on information obtained from reputable
#       sources external to developer.  The accuracy of these
#       various sources is not always known. Therefore, the
#       tolerances should not be interpreted as an indication of the
#       accuracy or precision of the Coordinate System Mapping
#       Package, but more as an indication of the accuracy of the
#       source.
#
#       Especially true in the case of inverse calculations, the
#       precision of the input numbers, usually truncated to six
#       decimal places can leave an output significantly off
#       from what is expected.
#
#       No test for the Equidistant Cylindrical projection is provided
#       as test cases from an independent source for this projection have
#		not been located.
#
#  The following tests were verified using CORPSCON. Note, that CS_MAP
#  uses a more accurate meridional arc calculation then does the version
#  of CORPSCON used in generating these tests. Therefore, variations as much
#  as a millimeter can be expected in the higher latitudes.

# The tolerances are very high on this one, probably due to
# the fact that it is a sphere only, and the projection is
# used only for one specific coordinate system, used to place
# both North and South America on a single map.  Thus, Synder
# probably didn't get very serious about precision.  The accuracy
# of the projeciton has been verified by comparing the inverse and
# the forward, and these compare very well.

# The above tests are designed to test the integrity of the projection
# and datum conversion software.  The following tests are designed to
# test the definitions of specific coordinate systems.  Therefore, only
# the Inverse direction is tested.  We should also add some test for
# the definitions of datums.  Note, however, that the Multiple Regression
# compiler has a built in test for all of those definitions.

# The following checks the ETRS89 <--> Irish Grid 1975 multiple regression.
#
# The following six tests (3 test cases, fwd and inv), were extracted from a document
# titled A Recomputation of the Transformation between Ireland75 and ETRF89", subtitled
# "PHI75 User's Guide and Software Developer's Notes."  This document actually has the
# multiple regression coefficients in it.  As you can see, we match these numbers fairly
# well, i.e. plus or minus a couple of millimeters.

# The following test results were obtained from the Services New Brunswick
# program NBGeoCalc, version 3.0. In addition to the test above, we include
# below a test of the conversion of LL27 to CSRS.  This conversion is not 
# expicitly supported by NBGeoCalc.  What is done is the transformation from
# NAD27 to ATS77 first, via the Transform algorithm.  Then, the ATS77 coordinates
# are converted to CSRS in the normal fashion.
#
# Since the data files required for these conversions are not part of the
# normal distribution (permission to distribute them is not certain, you will need
# to contact Services New Brunswick to obtain a license to use them), the following
# tests are commented out.

# In release 11.14, the axis swap was removed from the Krovak projection per
# suggestion by Czeck users.  These tests have, therefore, been modified to
# reflect this change.  Also in 11.14, the Krovak/95 projection has been
# deprecated, again per suggestion from Czech users, as it seems that
# algorithm is not really used by anyone.  The test remain, however, as
# a reasonably good check on the implementation of the Krovak projection.

# The folloowing test points are from Instituto Geogrfico Nacional, Spain
# Very precise and accurate.  Evidently, they were generated by the Spanish
# version of the Candian INTGRID and Australian GDAit programs.
#
# Note, there is an older Spanish .GSB file (a single gird) and a newer Spanish
# .GSB file that has two overlapping grids.  This test data set was generated
# using the newer .GSB file (circa 2005).

# Iceland Grid tests.
#
# In the two older Icelandic grids, Eastings are defined to increase to the
# west.  This means any map made with that coordinate system would be mirrored
# and look awfully funny.  Thus, the CS-MAP implementation inverts the sign of
# the easting so that the absolute value is the expected coordinate value,
# but eastings increase to the east and thus provide for a map that looks
# correct in thetypical GIS/CAD/Mapping application.

# The following test points were generated by CS-MAP!!!
#
# That is, these test points were _NOT_ generated by a third party source.
# They were generated by CS-MAP prior to the overhaul of the RGF93 <--> NTF
# datum transformation code and included here as a means of verifying that the
# mentioned overhaul effort did not produce any regressions.
#
# To obtain these results, the Rgf93ToNtf.gdc file should list only the
# national grid file gr3d97a.txt file (the original grid shift file format).
# See below for test cases which require local municipality grid files.
# The specific locations in the following 60 test cases were generated
# using a random number generator, and therefore may include test cases which
# are also covered by a/the local municipality grid files. 
#
# The tolerances are set quite high (1.0E-08 rather than 1.0E-09) as the
# inverse function, as documented by the French IGN uses a less precise
# inverse algorithm than we would use.  The "official algoirthm produces an
# inverse precise to +/- 2 millimeters.  The algorithm CS-MAP traditionally
# uses produces an inverse prcise to +/- 0.5 millimeters.  The code to both
# algorithms is in the CS_rgf93ToNtf.c module, so you can select the
# algorithm you prefer.  The distribution uses the "official" algoirthm.

# The following test points were provided by a municipality in France.  Their
# presence here is to test the local grid facility for France; specifically
# a file named 'cub_r93_l.gsb'.  This is supposedly for the city of Bordeaux.
# In the file name, the trailing _l means the byte order is for little endian
# machines.  All grid shift files accessed by CS-MAP are assumed to be in
# little endian byte order; byte swap is automatically performed by CS-MAP
# when necessary.
#
# It is not clear that it is permissible to distribute this grid shift data
# file; so it is not a part of the Open Source distribution and in the
# distribution, these test points are normally commented out.
#
# This first set of points are cartesian to cartesian, but an NTF to RGF93
# datum shift is implied.  The tolerance was chosen to match the precision of
# the test point coordinates.
#
# The tolerances here are higher than we would normally expect.  Best guess is
# that there is a slight discrepancy between how the Lambert Tangential
# projection is implemented in different software.  We have run this test
# using the LM1SP as the equivalent of the LMTAN, and achieved the same
# results.  Thus, two totally independent codings of two independent
# algorithms produced the same results.  Also, we added the Lambert Tangential
# to the creep test and found a creep of less than 2 millimeters per thousand
# roundtrips.  So we have good reason to believe the CS-MAP implementation of
# the Lambert Tangential is preety decent if not rather precise.  So, until we
# have the information necessary to match the French IGN numbers more
# precisely, we'll have to live with a tolerance higher than we would like.

#	These tests verify the operation of the CHENYX06.gsb data file and the
#	internal (hard coded) geocentric conversion from CH1903+ to CHTRS95.
#
#	The tolerances on these cases have been expanded to account for the fact
#	at this time this conversion test facility is two dimensional in nature.
#	The data points have significant elevations and the elevations are adjusted
#	from orthometric height to ellipsoid height and back again.  Thus, the
#	tolerances are rather high.
#
#	Manual testing with 3D coordinates indicate that the actual conversion
#	results are on the order of 1.0E-09/1.0E-03 (varies depending upon the elevation
#	of the test point).
