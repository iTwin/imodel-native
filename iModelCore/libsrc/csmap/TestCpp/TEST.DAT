#       Each line represents a coordinate conversion
#       test.  The first three and the second three
#       elements represent a location.  The first
#       element of each location is the coordinate
#       system name.  The second is the X coordinate
#       or longitude, the third element is the Y
#       coordinate or latitude.
#
#       Each test consists of converting the first
#       location to the coordinate system of the
#       second and comparing the results.  The last
#       two elements are the X and Y tolerance of
#       the comparison.
#
#       Each test is based on information obtained from reputable
#       sources external to developer.  The accuracy of these
#       various sources is not always known. Therefore, the
#       tolerances should not be interpreted as an indication of the
#       accuracy or precision of the Coordinate System Mapping
#       Package, but more as an indication of the accuracy of the
#       source.
#
#       Especially true in the case of inverse calculations, the
#       precision of the input numbers, usually truncated to six
#       decimal places can leave an output significantly off
#       from what is expected.
#
#       No test for the Equidistant Cylindrical projection is provided
#       as test cases from an independent source for this projection have
#		not been located.
#
#  The following tests were verified using CORPSCON. Note, that CS_MAP
#  uses a more accurate meridional arc calculation then does the version
#  of CORPSCON used in generating these tests. Therefore, variations as much
#  as a millimeter can be expected in the higher latitudes.

# used only for one specific coordinate system, used to place
# both North and South America on a single map.  Thus, Synder

# The above tests are designed to test the integrity of the projection
# and datum conversion software.  The following tests are designed to
# test the definitions of specific coordinate systems.  Therefore, only
# the Inverse direction is tested.  We should also add some test for
# the definitions of datums.  Note, however, that the Multiple Regression
# compiler has a built in test for all of those definitions.
#
#   NOTE   NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE
#
#  UNLIKE ALL OF THE NUMBERS IN THE TESTS ABOVE, THE TESTS GIVEN BELOW
#  HAVE NOT BEEN VERIFIED AGAINST A SOURCE OUTSIDE OF CS-MAP ITSELF.
#  THEREFORE, NO GUARANTEE EXISTS THAT THESE NUMBERS ARE CORRECT.

# The following six tests (3 test cases, fwd and inv), were extracted from a document
# titled A Recomputation of the Transformation between Ireland75 and ETRF89", subtitled
# "PHI75 User's Guide and Software Developer's Notes."  This document actually has the
# multiple regression coefficients in it.  As you can see, we match these numbers fairly

# The following test results were obtained from the Services New Brunswick
# program NBGeoCalc, version 3.0. In addition to the test above, we include
# below a test of the conversion of LL27 to CSRS.  This conversion is not 
# expicitly supported by NBGeoCalc.  What is done is the transformation from
# NAD27 to ATS77 first, via the Transform algorithm.  Then, the ATS77 coordinates
# are converted to CSRS in the normal fashion.
#
# Since the data files required for these conversions are not part of the
# normal distribution (permission to distribute them is not certain, you will need
# to contact Services New Brunswick to obtain a license to use them), the following
# tests are commented out.

# In release 11.14, the axis swap was removed from the Krovak projection per
# suggestion by Czeck users.  These tests have, therefore, been modified to
# reflect this change.  Also in 11.14, the Krovak/95 projection has been
# deprecated, again per suggestion from Czech users, as it seems that
# algorithm is not really used by anyone.  The test remain, however, as
# a reasonably good check on the implementation of the Krovak projection.

# The folloowing test points are from Instituto Geogrfico Nacional, Spain
# Very precise and accurate.  Evidently, they were generated by the Spanish
# version of the Candian INTGRID and Australian GDAit programs.
#
# Note, there is an older Spanish .GSB file (a single gird) and a newer Spanish
# .GSB file that has two overlapping grids.  This test data set was generated
# using the newer .GSB file (circa 2005).

# Iceland Grid tests.
#
# In the two older Icelandic grids, Eastings are defined to increase to the
# west.  This means any map made with that coordinate system would be mirrored
# and look awfully funny.  Thus, the CS-MAP implementation inverts the sign of
# the easting so that the absolute value is the expected coordinate value,
# but eastings increase to the east and thus provide for a map that looks
# correct in thetypical GIS/CAD/Mapping application.

# The tolerances had to be adjusted slightly; but certainly within reasonable

# The following test points were generated by CS-MAP!!!
#
# That is, these test points were _NOT_ generated by a third party source.
# They were generated by CS-MAP prior to the overhaul of the RGF93 <--> NTF
# datum transformation code and included here as a means of verifying that the
# mentioned overhaul effort did not produce any regressions.
#
# To obtain these results, the Rgf93ToNtf.gdc file should list only the
# national grid file gr3d97a.txt file (the original grid shift file format).
# See below for test cases which require local municipality grid files.
# The specific locations in the following 60 test cases were generated
# using a random number generator, and therefore may include test cases which
# are also covered by a/the local municipality grid files. 
#
# The tolerances are set quite high (1.0E-08 rather than 1.0E-09) as the
# inverse function, as documented by the French IGN uses a less precise
# inverse algorithm than we would use.  The "official algoirthm produces an
# inverse precise to +/- 2 millimeters.  The algorithm CS-MAP traditionally
# uses produces an inverse prcise to +/- 0.5 millimeters.  The code to both
# algorithms is in the CS_rgf93ToNtf.c module, so you can select the
# algorithm you prefer.  The distribution uses the "official" algoirthm.

# The following test points were provided by a municipality in France.  Their
# presence here is to test the local grid facility for France; specifically
# a file named 'cub_r93_l.gsb'.  This is supposedly for the city of Bordeaux.
# In the file name, the trailing _l means the byte order is for little endian
# machines.  All grid shift files accessed by CS-MAP are assumed to be in
# little endian byte order; byte swap is automatically performed by CS-MAP
# when necessary.
#
# It is not clear that it is permissible to distribute this grid shift data
# file; so it is not a part of the Open Source distribution and in the
# distribution, these test points are normally commented out.
#
# This first set of points are cartesian to cartesian, but an NTF to RGF93
# datum shift is implied.  The tolerance was chosen to match the precision of
# the test point coordinates.
#
# The tolerances here are higher than we would normally expect.  Best guess is
# that there is a slight discrepancy between how the Lambert Tangential
# projection is implemented in different software.  We have run this test
# using the LM1SP as the equivalent of the LMTAN, and achieved the same
# results.  Thus, two totally independent codings of two independent
# algorithms produced the same results.  Also, we added the Lambert Tangential
# to the creep test and found a creep of less than 2 millimeters per thousand
# roundtrips.  So we have good reason to believe the CS-MAP implementation of
# the Lambert Tangential is preety decent if not rather precise.  So, until we
# have the information necessary to match the French IGN numbers more
# precisely, we'll have to live with a tolerance higher than we would like.

#	These tests verify the operation of the CHENYX06.gsb data file and the
#	internal (hard coded) geocentric conversion from CH1903+ to CHTRS95.
#
#	The tolerances on these cases have been expanded to account for the fact
#	at this time this conversion test facility is two dimensional in nature.
#	The data points have significant elevations and the elevations are adjusted
#	from orthometric height to ellipsoid height and back again.  Thus, the
#	tolerances are rather high.
#
#	Manual testing with 3D coordinates indicate that the actual conversion
#	results are on the order of 1.0E-09/1.0E-03 (varies depending upon the elevation
#	of the test point).

#
# Testing of the NSRS 2007 and NSRS 2011 datum shifts.  These tests are
# specific to test the implementation of the GEOCON datum shift file code.  The
# tests are designed to test that facility only. Test data typically was/is
# generated by the geocon.exe program which is provided by the NGS.  See:
#
#   http://beta.ngs.noaa.gov/GEOCON/
#
# To use the geocon.exe program, the test point data, and the converted
# results, must be in Blue Book format.  For details on the blue book format,
# see:
#
#	http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/FGCS/BlueBook/pdf/Chapter2.pdf
#
# Look to Console Utilities for C++ code for generating and deciphering
# blue book format data files (Records *80* and *86*).
#
# Tolerance on these initial tests is set at 1.5E-09 = 0.000005 seconds of arc,
# which (in the case of latitude) approximates to 0.2 millimeters; about the
# width of a strand of human hair.

# The following are test automatically generated by CS-MAP code.  They are
# specifically designed to test the veracity of the home grown 48hpgn.l?s file
# pair.  That is, using points manually selected to be centrally located within
# the coverage of an official ??hpgn.l?s file, the original ??hpgnl?s file is
# used to compute the test result.  We then use that test case to see how
# close the 48hpgn.l?s file matches the ??hpgn.l?s result.  In this first set
# of test cases, the results are expected to be very close and a very tight
# tolerance is specified.

# The following tests are manually selected points at the junctures of state
# boundaries where there is known to exist overlap between the official
# ??hpgn.l?s files.  In this case, there are multiple test cases, each
# generated using a different official ??hpgn.l?s file.  We fully expect there
# to be non-trivial discrepancies here.  However, we expect the discrepancies
# to be below the rather tight tolerance provided and consider these
# discrepancies to be acceptable given the success of the above test points
# which indicate that the larger discrepancy only occurs at or near a state
# boundary.
#
# Certain of these test cases required higher than normal tolerance to pass.
# These cases are identified by comments on the right.  The highest tolerance
# encountered at the time of this writing is 3.0E-06, which equates to
# approximately 33 centimeters.  This is quite large! It only occurs once at
# the conjunction of CO, OK, and KS at ~ 102W:37N and in the longitude only.
# Check the respective ??hpgn.los files, yields the following values for this
# specific grid point in the three different files:
#	CO = 0.00034
#	OK = 0.01210
#   KS = 0.01203
#
# What's a poor software developer to do???
#
# 3.0E-07 (of latitude) approximates to 3 centimeters

# Note that EPSG 7-2 2014 (printed page 23) uses the International Ellipsoid
# while the definition in the 8.05 dataset indicates the datum to be NAD27
# which is referenced to the Clarke 1966 ellipsoid.  The documentation in
# the Guidance Note appears to be a cut & paste typo; the numbers jive when

# Tolerance is rather large (7 millimeters) compared to other transformations.
# Can't explain this.  Did verify that the projective portion is good to tenths
# of a millimeter.  Perhaps using the opposite data file OSTN15_NTv2_ETRStoOSGB.gsb
