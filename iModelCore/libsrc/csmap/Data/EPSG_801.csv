My best guess as to the confusion level is that while a datum with the name Ireland 1975 did exist for a while, it is not the actual datum which is normally used.  This confusion is amplified by the name of this coordinate system, TM75 / Irish Grid, which is actually referenced to the datum name Ireland 1965.  Sooooo!!!!
