Note that this is a generic grid file interpolation object.  Thus the specifics

here is what is common to all file formats.

Also note that the design is such that a specific transformation of this

we can support the generic French grid file which covers all of France, and
also include the NTv2 format files used by several municipal governments in
the same transformation.

   problem is that the "RGF93_to_NTF-G-Grid" transformation converts from RGF93
   (i.e. WGS84) to NTF, while the "NTF-G_to_WGS84" transformation converts
   in the opposite direction.  This defect is introduced, and a lot of
   additional confusion is experienced, because the French grid interpolation
   data file, "gr3df97a.txt" converts from the new to the old (RGF93 -> NTF),
   while all other grid data interpoolation files convert from the old to
   the new.  The "old to the new" convention of most all grid data files
   (except the French) is consistent with standard datum definitions (i.e.
   convert to WGS84, the newer datum).  There are better weays to deal with
   these issues.  Scheduling pressure and the need to pass a comprehensive
   regression test have lead to this rather kludgy solution.
   
   TODO -- Fix this in a more generic manner.  I suspect, that we need to
   define a new Molodensky transformation that goes in the opposite direction
   as the normal one (i.e. flip the signs on the translation vector) and use
   that as the fall back for transforms which involving NTF and RGF93 which
