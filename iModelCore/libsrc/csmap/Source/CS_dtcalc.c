	Both forward and inverse calculations are coded for each transformation
	technique.  An initialize function is also included.  Each of these
	functions initialize a parameter structure given a cs_Datum_ structure
	for the source datum and the target datum.  These initialize functions
	do, essentially, what a constructor would do in the C++ environment.

	Be careful, and note that the initialization functions assume two
	definitions which use the same type of transformations.  This is done
	to support the very small number (one as I write) of datum trasnformations
	which bypass WGS84 and go direcrtly from one datum to another.  Note the
	the DMA Mreg initialize function has a target datum of WGS84 hard coded
	into it.
	
	Generalized calculation of geocentric cartesian coordinates,
	including the inverse, are also included.
