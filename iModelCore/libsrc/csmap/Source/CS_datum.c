/******************************************************************************
	The following code maps the steps included in a "to84_via" algorithm.
	That is, currently, all datums define how to get from the datum being
	defined to WGS84.  With each, datum, a technique is encoded in the
	definition.  This table defines the specific conversions necessary
	to accomplish this,

	Note, a conversion map for "To84" and "From84" for each technique is
	provided.  The set of defines listed below are the values
	one finds for the "to84_via" variable in the datum definition.
	The enumerator is the list of codes which are used in this
	module to select and activate the specific different
	conversions.
	
	While there is a one to one correspondence,	we have opted for
	this mapping in an interim release as future releases will
	have a completely different system of mapping the
	alghorithms.

	In general, names without 3D or 3d in them are horizontal, or
	two dimensional variations.  For the current interim release,
	the three dimensional versions are not implemented.

**	struct cs_Dtcprm_ *dtc_ptr;	returns a pointer to the datum conversion
**								parameters to be used to perform the desired

**
**	This function returns the null pointer in the following
**	cases:
**
**	cs_NO_MEM					Insufficient memory to allocate the the
**								datum conversion definition block.
**	cs_DTC_DAT_F				An unsupported datum conversion was requested
**								and the dat_erf argument was set to as value
**								other than cs_DTCFLG_DAT_I or cs_DTCFLG_DAT_W.
**
**	To make a datum conversion, one first calls CS_dtcsu to
**	indicate the datums involved and how error conditions
**	are to be processed on the acutal conversion calls.
**	Once setup, CS_dtcvt is called to convert the actual
**	lat/long pairs.  CS_dtcvt requires a pointer as returned
**	by this function as its first argument.
**
**	DO NOT FREE THE RETURNED POINTER DIRECTLY.  To release
**	system resources allocated by any datum conversion, call
**	CS_dtcls.
**
**	The dat_erf argument may take either of the following
**	values:
**
**	cs_DTCFLG_DAT_I				Ignore any error condition.  If the
**								requested conversion is not supported
**								establish the NULL conversion.
**	cs_DTCFLG_DAT_W				Issue a warning message for unsupported
**								conversion requests, and establish the
**								NULL conversion.
**	cs_DTCFLG_DAT_W1			Issue a warning message once for
**								any case where the established
**								conversion is not the best
**								available, but only once during
**								the life of the process.
**
**	Any other value, or specifically zero, will cause a fatal
**	error message to be generated if the conversion established
**	is not the best available.
**
**	Beginning with release 6.0, if either coordinate system has
**	the null string for the datum key name in the cs_Datum_
**	structure buried within the cs_Csprm_ structure, the
**	null conversion is returned.  Thus, coordinate systems
**	can be based on an ellipsoid and conversion to LL possible
**	without having to assign a datum to a coordinate system,
**	or even more inconvenient, establish an LL coordinate
**	system with the same datum to prevent a datum conversion
**	of some sort.
**
**	This function always returns a conversion, even if it is
**	the do nothing conversion, the NULL conversion.  Users
**	should examine the value of cs_Error after calling this
**	function to see if something less than the ideal
**	conversion has been set up.  This condition can exist
**	only in those cases where the software has been
**	modularized into optional components.  If the entire
**	system is always delivered, these conditions can be
**	ignored.

**			as returned by CS_dtcsu.
**	double ll_in;				the lat/long pair to be converted.
**	double ll_out;				the converted lat/long result is returned here.
**	int status;					returns zero if CS_dtcvt was able to produce a
**								perfectly normal result. +1 is returned if a
**								data availability probelm precluded a normal
**								calculation.  A -1 is returned if some other
**								type of error (already reported to CS_erpt)
**								caused the calculation to fail.
**
**	The ll_in and ll_out arguments may point to the same array.
**
**	A zero return value indicates that the datum conversion
**	was completed as normally expected.  A -1 value indicates
**	that a hard system type error, which has been reported to
**	CS_erpt, was encounterd.  The results in this case are
**	simply a copy of the input lat/long.
**
**	A value of +1 is returned when a problem whose cause is
**	likely to be that the lat/long to be shifted is outside
**	the normal range of the datum shifts is presented for
**	shifting.  For example, attempting to shift a lat/long
**	in Japan to or from NAD27 will produce this result.  In
**	these cases, this function will attempt to make the
**	datum shift using alternative techniques.
**
**	NOTE: most status values are generated in the sub-functions
**	of this module.
**
**	The name here is really a misnomer for historical reasons.
**	Originally, this function converted only between the
**	North American Datums of 1927 and 1983.  Therefore, it
**	was given the name of Datum convert.  This module has
**	since been upgraded to convert between most all geodetic
**	reference systems.
**
**	To make a datum conversion, one first calls CS_dtcsu to
**	obtain a pointer to the datum conversion parameters.
**	The datum conversion parameter structure contains
**	pointers to the functions involved and maintains the
**	error processing specification made at setup time.
