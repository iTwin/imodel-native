/* The following static variables are used to carry the translation of a WKT
   string to CS-MAP format.
   
   On the initial call to the hook function for CS_csdef (), the WKT is parsed
   by CS_wktToCsEx and the results of that parse are saved in these static
   variables.
   
   On a successful parse, CS_wktCsDefFunc returns the definition saved in
   wktCsDef.  On the subsequent CS_wktDtDefFunc and CS_wktDtDefFunc calls,
   the respective functions compare the requested key name with that stored in
   the static definition structures below.  If the names match, the respective
   definition is returned.  If the name does not match, the respective
   functions return a zero which instructs the respective CS_??def function
   to do its own thing.
   
   Note, that CS_wktToCsEx pretty much verifies that all is OK before returning
   a non-negative status value.  In the case of a negative status value, an
   approriate error indication will have already been reported to CS_erpt, and
   the CS_csdef function will cause that indication to be reported to the end
   user in the same way that an invalid key name would. */
