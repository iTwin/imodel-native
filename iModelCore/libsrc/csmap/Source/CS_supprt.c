**
**	In the world of DLL's, multiple threads, and who knows what
**	else, memory allocation and releasing has many pit falls.
**	CS-MAP now uses these function exclusively to allocate and
**	free memory. It is also documented in the manual that CS_free
**	be used to release all manner of things. In this manner,
**	hopefully, the same functions will be doing all the malloc'ing
**	and free'ing, in the same environment.
**
**	I think the problem is that a malloc and free get linked into
**	the DLL, and another malloc and free get linked into the main
**	process. If these two functions behave differently for what
**	ever reason (release levels, multi-thread vs single thread,
**	etc.) the heap(s) get corrupted and eventually everything
**	becomes unglued.
**
**	In the future, these functions may be used to maintain a local
**	heap for CS-MAP when running as a DLL.

**	void *rec;					pointer to the data record to be swapped.
**	char *frmt;					pointer to a character string which defins the
**								format of the record.  See Remarks below.
**	int stat;					returns 0 if now swapping was done,
**								1 if swapping was performed,
**								-1 if swap order of this machine is
**								not supported.
**
**	If this function is compiled for a little endian machine,
**	this function simply returns after doing nothing.  This
**	is sensed by the value of a long which is initialized as
**	a character array.  Thus, this function, and the whole of
**	CS_MAP Release 6.0 and later, always assumes that it is
**	reading and writing in little endian order.
**
**	The frmt argument is a null terminated character strings
**	which defines the format of the record to be swapped.  In
**	te simple case, there is one character for each data item,
**	lower case is required:
**
**		c = an 8 bit byte
**		s = 16 bit integer
**		l = 32 bit integer
**		f = 32 bit floating point number (IEEE)
**		d = 64 bit floating point number (IEEE)
**
**	Any of the above data types can be preceded by a count.
**	For example, "32c4l32c4d" would indicate that the item
**	to be swapped consists of a 32 byte character array,
**	an array of 4 longs, another 32 byte character array,
**	and an array of 4 doubles.  (CS_bswap does nothing to
**	character arrays.)
**
**	Characters other than the decimal digits and the five
**	characters given above are considered to be 'c'.  Of
**	course, the null character terminates the specification.
**
**	Example for the cs_Eldef_ structure:
**
**		"12c4cdddds64"
**
**	Notice that we ignore the problem of some machines,
**	notably some older DEC machines, which have some strange
**	way of ordering bytes.  We deal only with little endian
**	(least significant byte first) or big endian (most
**	significant byte first).  This greatly simplifies things.
**
**	ALSO NOTICE: there is no way to specify the direction
**	of the swap.  The swap is binary reversible.  That is,
**	calling this function twice on the same data gets you
**	back exactly what you started with.  Since the code has
**	no way of knowing what you are passing it (i.e. little
**	endian or big endian) its up to the caller to know what
**	they're passing and what they will get back.
**
**	In CS_MAP, we pass everything we have just read which
**	has binary data through this function, and we pass
**	everything which we are about to write (which has binary
**	data) through this function.  This assumes that all
**	binary data files are maintained in the little endian
**	(i.e. DOS) form.  This enables users to use DOS programs
**	(like Tralaine) to maintain the coordinate system
**	dictionary and port the file to another platform, like
**	a SUN SparcStation.
