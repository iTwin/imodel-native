/*
	This file contains the implementation of the Ostn97 object.

	Ostn97 is based on a text file with some 982,101 records, i.e.
	lines of text.  Each line contains the translation in cartesian
	form from the normal computed values using ETRS89 coordinates
	to the OSGB36 National Coordinate System.  That is, the data file
	represents a 700 x 1400 grid whose density is one kilometer.

	In addition to a construction/destruction this module provides
	both a forward anda n inverse function which will provide the
	approriate translations.  Note that these functions are expected
	to be used in conjunction with the normal Transverse Mercator
	functions which would normally implement OSGB36 and OSTN97.

	Note that some of the stuff in the ogject may look strnage in
	this implementation.  This is due to the fact that the code is
	constructed with an eye to a future C++ implementation.  The
	C++ object will be derived from certain base classes and certain
	virtual functions will need to be supported.  Thus, there is
	some stuff here that looks redundant and unnecessary.
