/*
	This file contains the implementation of the Ostn02 object.

	Ostn02 is based on a text file with some 876,951 records, i.e.
	lines of text.  Each line contains the translation in cartesian
	form from the normal computed values using ETRS89 coordinates
	to the OSGB36 National Coordinate System.  That is, the data file
	represents a 700 x 1250 grid whose density is one kilometer.

	Please note the following:

	1> Each record also carries a Geoid Height value and a
	integer which indicates which vertical datum was used to
	determine the Geoid Height.

	2> This makes for yet additional problem.  In order to obtain a
	Geoid Height, therefore, one must first obtain ETRF89 X & Y
	coordinates for the point.  This is in contrast to the normal
	situation where Geoid Heights can be determined directly
	from latitude and longitude.  Painful.

	3> In addition to a construction/destruction this module provides
	both a forward anda n inverse function which will provide the
	appropriate translations.  Note that these functions are expected
	to be used in conjunction with the normal Transverse Mercator
	functions which would normally implement OSGB36 and OSTN02.

	4> Some of the stuff in the ogject may look strange in this
	implementation.  This is due to the fact that the code is constructed
	with an eye to a future C++ implementation.  The C++ object will be
	derived from certain base classes and certain virtual functions will
	need to be supported.  Thus, there is some stuff here that looks
	redundant and unnecessary.

	5> The following pointer is used to maintain a single cs_Ostn02_ object.
	It is "created" by the first function that needs it.  It is only
	destroyed explicitly by an application call:
		
		CSdeleteOstn02 (cs_Ostn02Ptr);
		cs_Ostn0297Ptr = NULL;

	or by calling the CS_recvr () function.  That is, once one of these
	is actually constructed, we keep it around in case we need it
	again.  This is for performance purposes.

	6> The shifts in the data file are the shifts from ETRF89 to OSGB36
	coordinates.  The shifts are in the form of cartesian coordinates,
	i.e. delta X and delta Y in meters.

	7> Thus the shifts extracted from this file must be applied to
	projected coordinates (not the latitude and longitude).

	8> The shifts are from ETRF89 to OSGB36.  This is opposite of what
	most similar data files generate.

	FUN!!!   FUN!!!   FUN!!!
