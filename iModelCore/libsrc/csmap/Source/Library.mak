#
# This make file is designed primarily to build the entire target,
# csmap.lib in this case, from scratch in an "installation" environment.
# The secondary objective of the design is to minimize the maintenance
# requirements of achieving the primary objective.  Thus, coding of a
# comprehensive map of interdependencies between files is deliberately
# avoided.
#
# Thus, one should _NOT_ expect this make file to compile only the
# specific modules you might have changed in a development/debug
# environment.  Such may happen, and you may be thankful; but do _NOT_
# rely on this.  Fortunately, build times on current Linux systems are
# so small I suspect you will probably never consider the build to
# be overly inefficient.
#
# Note that simply adding files with the appropriate extensions to
# the appropriate directories, automatically includes them in the
# make process.  Removing files from specific directories has the same
# affect.  To achieve this objective, certain files in particular are
# specifically noted and referenced in this make file and removed from the
# construction of the library.  Your maintenance/development activities may
# require you to add a module name to these lists.  At, or about, line 272
# below, is a convenient place to switch to hard coded module lists if
# such is desired.
#
# This make file was been written with the EXPRESS requirement that it
# exists in the "CsMapDev/Source" and that directory is the current
# working directory of the make executable which is processing it; with the
# original intent being that this makefile would be invoked by a higher
# level make file which executes something like the following:
#
#	$(MAKE) -C./Source -fLibrary.mak
#
# All the essential information about the desired build is expected to be
# passed in environmental variables.

# compilations will not be batched and a new instance of the compiler is
# invoked for each module.  Slows us down a bit, but overall helps preserve
# sanity when trying to build multiple configurations of the library from a
# single set of source files, which is a major objective of this makefile.
