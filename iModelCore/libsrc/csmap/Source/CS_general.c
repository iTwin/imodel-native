**	This function exists specifically for the multi-threaded
**	environment of Windows 32/95/NT.  Threads are quite different
**	from UNIX processes in that they share the same data address
**	space as the parent (and all colleague) threads.  Thus, in
**	a multi-threaded program using CS-MAP, two threads would
**	quite normally be modifying the same data.
**
**	Since each thread has it's own stack space all automatic
**	variables are safe.  We need only concern ourselves with the
**	static/global variables in use.  There are several of these
**	in CS-MAP.
**
**	This function is the result of our initial effort to make CS-MAP
**	thread safe.  We currently rely on the compiler's ability
**	(Microsoft and Borland provide this, not sure about Watcom)
**	to declare a variable as being thread local.  While the
**	documentation is rather obscure, we assume this means that
**	all variable declared as thread local are assign addresses in
**	a data segment for which a unique copy is generated for each
**	new thread.  It is not clear from the documentation, but we
**	also assume that each new thread will get an uninitialized
**	copy of whatever was present in the parent thread.
**
**	The primary purpose of this module is to initialize all variables
**	declared as thread local to appropriate start up values. The
**	one argument indicates if the default values for datums,
**	ellipsoids, and units are to be preserved from the parent
**	thread.
**
**	If all of our assumptions are correct, and we have properly
**	isolated all the appropriate variables, you should be able
**	to use CS-MAP safely in a multi-threaded environment by:
**
**	1) Recompiling CS-MAP assuring that the csThread define actually
**	   maps to the correct stuff for you compiler.
**	2) Calling this function in the new thread code, immedaitely
**	   after the new thread is created.
**
**	If there are problems with multi-threaded use, the problems
**	will be in one of two areas:
**
**	1) File names and the muliple use of the cs_Dir character array.
**	2) The use of the NAD27/83 and HPGN datum shift caches.  These
**	   are malloc'ed, but the pointer to same is in a global static
**	   variable.  Thus, it is possible for two different threads to
**	   be manipulating the same stack without knowledge of what
**	   the other is doing.
**
**	If any of this doesn't work, we'll have to do some major
**	surgery to several functions, and change the calling sequence
**	of some.  Stick to the higher level Application Program
**	Interfaces and you wll be insulated from these changes.
