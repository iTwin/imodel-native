	Apple doesn't support findfirst or ftw.  So, the following function
	has been written to support use of CS-MAP on the Apple.  It should be
	noted, that the ftw functionality is no longer a part of the standard
	library.  

    Note: ftw is only used in the CS_swpal function in the CS_rlsUpdt module.
    The CS_swpal function is only used in the CStestS.c  function of the CS_Test
    (console test) module.  Since it is not used in the library portion of the product,
    It should be moved to be a function in the CStestSupport.c source  module,
    With a prototype added to the cs_Test.h module.

    Alternatively, the ‘S’ test of the CS_Test module could be removed and
    all references to CS_ftw could then be removed from the product.
	
    CS_rlsUpdt is used to update
	older dictionary files to a newer format.  Since the dictionary files
	have not changed in many years, it's use is rather limited also.
