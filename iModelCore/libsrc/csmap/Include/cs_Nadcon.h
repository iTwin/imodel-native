/* US NADCON .LAS File and /LOS File
The following structure is used to represent a grid data file of the
NADCON format.  FOr horizontal applications, two are required to
complete a grid.  The file with the .LAS extension is used for the
latitude shifts, and the file with the .LOS extension is used for the
the longitude shifts.  Thus, for horizontal applications, a pair of
these structures is compbined into a single structure which represents
the complete geodetic transformation method.

The header information on a US Grid file has the following format.
The size of the header record is always equal to the size of a
record in the file.  Since a record in the file consists of an
entire row of grid points (west to east), the size of the header
is not fixed.  Note, that since a lot of this stuff is binary, byte
swapping may be required. */
