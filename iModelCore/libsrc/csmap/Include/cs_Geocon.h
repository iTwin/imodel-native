**                                                                           **
**	This is the CS-MAP rendition of the US National Geodetic Survey's grid   **
**	system for converting from NAD83/HARN to NAD83/2011.  Thus, to get from, **
**	say, NAD27, to NAD83/2011 one needs to:                                  **
**		1> use NADCON to convert from NAD27 to NAD83, then                   **
**		2> Use HARN to convert from NAD83 to HARN, then                      **
**		3> Use GEOCON with the appropriate grid files to convert from        **
**		   HARN to NAD83/2011                                                **
**                                                                           **
**	As of this writing, we are assuming NAD83/2012 is just another           **
**	name for NAD83/2011. We are not at all sure exactly how to distinguish   **
**	between a 2007 and a 2011 grid data file.  Hopefully, we'll be able to   **
**	figure this all out when we have some code running which will enable to  **
**	examine the results using different grid data files.                     **
**                                                                           **
**	We have used a 5 character naming system since the origin of CS-MAP      **
**  in 1987 (when function names were limited to 8 characters (seven in      **
**	some compiler/linker products).  Thus, we have chosen to use the         **
**	following names as appropriate in the Geodetic Transformation naming     **
**	convention: "geocn", "cs_Geocn_".                                        **
**                                                                           **
**	Note that the grid file formats and calculation algorithms are the same  **
**	as that used in the NGS's Geoid 1999 grid effort.  Thus, we have most    **
**	all of the code necessary to implement this new grid file based          ** 
**	transformation.  Question as I write this comment: Do we isolate the     **
**	Geoid99 code and rename it so that it takes on the more generic          **
**	function which has mow made itself evident?  Think so, especially since  **
**	data files in this same format are used for the vertical portion of the  **
**	base geodetic transformation, and also for using the quality of          **
**	conversion data files associated with this geodetic transformation.      **
**                                                                           **
**	Another reason for isolating/renaming/refactoring is that our new        **
**	Geodetic Transformation paradigm requires several new functions which    **
**	do not exist in the original Geoid 1999 implementation.                  **
**                                                                           **
**	So, the end result of these deliberations is that much of what you       **
**	find in this header file and its corresponding implementation file(s)    **
**	is a cut/paste/replace of the code previously existing in cs_map.h and   **
**	CS_geoid99.c with struct and function names such as csGeoid99GridFile_   **
**	and CSnewGeoid99GridFile.  The new names will adhere to the naming       **
**	system used in the rewrite of Geodetic Transformations initiated by      **
**	RFC 2.                                                                   **
**                                                                           **
**	The actual, "official", NGS code for doing this transformation           **
**	is written in (drum roll please) FORTRAN.  For integrity purposes, the   **
**	actual FORTRAN code is included as a huge comment at the tail end of     **
**	implementation file associated with this header file.                    ** 
**                                                                           **
**	The data files for this geodetic conversion, as it applies to
**	NAD832007 and(?) NAD83/2011 come in groups of 6.  Our implementation     **
**  relies pretty heavily on this nameing convention in order to get the     **
**	data files properly paired with each other.  Since the coverage and      **
**	grid cell size are the same in each of a paired set, a comparison of     **
**	these values is done at construction time to insure that the files are   **
**	being properly paired with each other.                                   **

the purpose of the file it represents.

Applications in which this file format is used:

	1> NAD83/HARN to NAD83/2012 geodetic cconversions,
	   both horizontal and vertical  (ext = .b)
	2> Geoid 2012 Height calculation (ext = .bin)

	4> Geoid 2003 Height calculation (ext = .bin)
	5> Geoid 1999 Height calculation (ext = .bin)

Note sure at the current time if we'll be able to distinguish a 2007
grid file from a 2007 grid file.  Thus, this distinction may disappear.

/* Geocon Grid Cell Object -->  Used to hold the definition of a grid cell.
   A Geocon frid cell is similar in function to the grid cell (with an
   unqualified name) which is used in the NADCON and NTv2 datum shift
   calculations. However, a Geocon grid cell carries nine data values
   in a array of nine doubles. The interpolation is therefore, a bit more
   mathematically rigourous that the standard bi-linear interpolation used
   in the NADCON and NTv2 environments.

   The grid cell is identified by the grid indices (zero based in our case)
   of the central data element. The data extraction algorithm always extracts
   a cell such that the point being converted is closer to the central
   point than any of the others.  Thus, when determining if we can use
   a specific grid cell, we will use the integral indicies rather than
   a range of coverage type calculation.

   The array of doubles is used as follows:
   
		IDX            [0]   [1]   [2]

		                    NORTH

		[2]     W      nw     n    ne      E
		[1]     E      w     ctr    e      A
		[0]     S      sw     s    se      S
		  	    T                          T 
				            SOUTH

   Note that the first record in the data files is the southernmost record,
   amd that the values in each record start at the western edge and run to
   the eastern edge (i.e. left to right, west to east).

**                                                                           **
**	While two such files are required to perform a datum shift (e.g. HARN    **
**	to NAD83/2007), a single file is used for other purposes such as geoid   **
**	height calculations.  Thus, is it convenient to have an object which can **
**	be used independently to access a single file of this type.              **
**                                                                           **
**	While not really used in any way, we do our best to classify the file    **
**	type and purpose to aid in debugging. The need for byte swappping is     **
**	determined by a static data constant which indicates the byte order of   **
**	the processor we are running on, and examination of the data in the      **
**	file header.  I.e. the first two elements in the header are 8 byte       **
**	doubles which are a valid latitude and a valid ongitude values.  Clearly **
**	we swap if necessary to get values which meet this criteria.			 **
**                                                                           **
**	Files are now heavily buffered.  In fact, in some cases the	entire file  **
**	resides in memory after the first access.  In such cases, the file       **
**	stream will be closed.  Note, the typical GEOCON Grid Data file is more  **
**	than 25 megabytes.  Since two are required for a horizontal datum shift, **
**  buffering the entire file(s) would normally consume 50 megabytes of      **
**	memory.  We won't do that unless it is really necessary for performance  **
**  purposes.                                                                **
**                                                                           **
**	Please note that the grid cell size on GEOCON files is often set to      **
**	rather painful values.  I.e. the most popular of the several files uses  **
**	a geoid cell size of 0.0166666667 degrees (one minute of arc).  This is  **
**	is a rather unfriendly value to work with in a digital computer and      **
**	produces all sorts of strange bugs when working on the edge of a grid    **
**	cell or the entire grid itself.  Watch out for these problems.  Make     **
**	sure that, when using these types of values, you get extended precision  **
**	rather than just what appears in the files.  To accomplish this, you are **
**	likely to find that min/max type calculations are done using integers    **
**	carrying seconds of arc to insure maximum precison is obtained.          **
**                                                                           **
