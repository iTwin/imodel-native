/* The original Japanese data file is provided in text formm.  As a performance
   enhancement, we convert the ASCII text file to binary form upon the first
   access.  This conversion process uses the dates on the file to determine
   if a new binary version needs to be built.

   The following object is used to create, manage, and use a binary version
   of the Jgd2k data file.  We need a binary version to insulate ourselves
   from ths possibility of a variable length text file.  Also, it enables us
   to sort the data file.  There is no reason to believe that the text files
   will always be properly sorted for rapid access.

   Note, that unlike all the other grid data files, there is no guarantee that
   the coverage of any such file is rectangular.  Therefore, there is no way
   that the coverage scheme will work.  So, we are therefore limited to
   handling a single file at a time.  The coverage is determined by the
   coverage of that file.

   The binary file that we make consists of a number of the following records,
   with two doubles on the front.  The two doubles represent the
   southwesternmost meshcode in the file.  After the rather trivial header, the
   records appear in ascending order by mesh code.
   
   An attempt was made to make this file format generic, i.e. not specifically
   related to Japanese real estate.  Despite these efforts, there are two
   features of this format that makes the format rather specific to Japan:
   
   1> In generating mesh code, longitude are biased around the 100E meridian.
   2> The grid cell size is defined by the mesh encoding as being 45 seconds
      by 30 seconds.
