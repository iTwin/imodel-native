/**
 * A Thread pool for CPU bound tasks.
 *
 * @note A single queue backed by folly/LifoSem and folly/MPMC queue.
 * Because of this contention can be quite high,
 * since all the worker threads and all the producer threads hit
 * the same queue. MPMC queue excels in this situation but dictates a max queue
 * size
 *
 * @note LifoSem wakes up threads in Lifo order - i.e. there are only few
 * threads as necessary running, and we always try to reuse the same few threads
 * for better cache locality.
 * Inactive threads have their stack madvised away. This works quite well in
 * combination with Lifosem - it almost doesn't matter if more threads than are
 * necessary are specified at startup.
 *
 * @note stop() will finish all outstanding tasks at exit
 *
 * @note Supports priorities - priorities are implemented as multiple queues -
 * each worker thread checks the highest priority queue first. Threads
 * themselves don't have priorities set, so a series of long running low
 * priority tasks could still hog all the threads. (at last check pthreads
 * thread priorities didn't work very well)
