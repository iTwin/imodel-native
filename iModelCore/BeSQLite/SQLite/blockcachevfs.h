/*
** OVERVIEW
**
** This module provides a VFS that provides access to databases stored in
** Cloud-Backed-SQLite format in remote cloud containers. The VFS may operate
** in two modes:
**
**   1) Daemonless mode. This mode provides read/write access to remote
**      databases.
**
**   2) Daemon mode. This mode provides read-only access to remote databases,
**      but allows database clients from multiple processes to share a
**      single cache directory. This mode requires that the daemon process
**      be started before any VFS objects are created.
**
** In general, the same API is used to interface with a daemon or daemonless
** mode VFS. Please refer to the website documentation for more information.
**
** APPLICATION PROGRAMMING
**
** Creating and destroying VFS objects:
**
**   The application creates a Cloud Backed SQLite VFS object using the
**   sqlite3_bcvfs_create() API. Parameters to this call specify the name of
**   the VFS to create, and the path to a directory that the VFS will use to
**   store its various files. The directory should either be completely empty,
**   or a directory used previously by a Cloud Backed SQLite VFS, or a directory
**   that has a running CBS daemon using it. If the directory has a daemon
*    running in it, then the new VFS automatically connects to
**   that daemon and runs in daemon mode. Otherwise, if there is no daemon,
**   then the created VFS object runs in daemonless mode.
**
**   If the specified directory does not have a running CBS daemon, but was
**   used previously, then the new VFS object is initialized based on the state
**   of the directory - meaning that all containers that were attached when 
**   the previous VFS was shutdown are automatically reattached.
**
**   As well as creating a VFS object that may be used by database clients,
**   a successful call to sqlite3_bcvfs_create() returns an opaque handle
**   (type sqlite3_bcvfs*) that may be used to configure the VFS, attach
**   and detach containers, and other operations described below.
**
**   Once an application has finished with it and all database clients have
**   disconnected, the application may destroy the CBS VFS object
**   and reclaim all associated resources using sqlite3_bcvfs_destroy().
**
**   An application may create any number of VFS objects, but usually one
**   is sufficient. A single VFS object may be used to access databases
**   stored in multiple cloud containers across multiple providers.
**
** Configuring VFS objects:
**
**   Once a VFS object has been created, it must be configured. A VFS object
**   may be configured or reconfigured at any time, but most applications
**   will find it sufficient to configure the object once immediately after
**   it has been created.
**
**   Almost all applications will need to configure the VFS object with
**   an authentication callback using sqlite3_bcvfs_auth_callback(). This
**   callback is the only way the authentication data (e.g. an Azure SAS 
**   string or Google Cloud access token) may be provided to cloud storage
**   modules that require it.
**
**   Application logging (i.e. for debugging) is configure using
**   sqlite3_bcvfs_log_callback().
**
**   Various integer parameters may also be configured using
**   sqlite3_bcvfs_config(). Notably, the SQLITE_BCV_CACHESIZE parameter
**   may be usd with sqlite3_bcvfs_config() to configure the maximum size of
**   the local block cache in bytes.
**
** Attaching and detaching containers:
**
**   Before databases may be accessed, the cloud container that they reside
**   in must be "attached" to the VFS. Containers are attached using the
**   sqlite3_bcvfs_attach() API function. To attach a container, the
**   application specifies cloud storage system (e.g. "azure" or "google"),
**   the user-name used to connect to cloud storage, the name of the cloud
**   storage container as used by the remote system, and an alias that will
**   be used to refer to the container locally.
**
**   Unused containers may be detached from a VFS using sqlite3_bcvfs_detach().
**
** Opening and accessing databases:
**
**   Once one or more containers have been attached to the VFS, databases
**   contained within them may be opened and accessed by SQLite database
**   clients. This is done by specifying a path consisting of the container
**   alias (local name) and the database name, as follows:
**
**      /ALIAS/DATABASE
**
**   and using either an SQLite URI filename or the sqlite3_open_v[23]()
**   interface to specify the VFS name.
**
**   For example, with all error handling omitted, to create a new VFS
**   that uses directory "dirname" to store its files, then to use it
**   to access database "mydb.db" in container "mycont" belonging to 
**   Azure user "myuser":
**
**     sqlite3_bcvfs *pFs;
**     sqlite3 *db;
**
**     sqlite3_bcvfs_create("dirname", "myvfs", &pFs);
**     // ... configure VFS ...
**     sqlite3_bcvfs_attach(pFs, "azure", "myuser", "mycont", "myalias", 0, 0);
**     sqlite3_open_v2("/myalias/mydb.db", &db, SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE, "myvfs");
**
**   Assuming URI filenames are enabled (SQLITE_CONFIG_URI), the following
**   may be used in place of the sqlite3_open_v2() call above:
**
**     sqlite3_open("file:/myalias/mydb.db?vfs=myvfs", &db);
**
** Poll and Upload operations:
**
**   The sqlite3_bcvfs_poll() and sqlite3_bcvfs_upload() and
**   APIs are used to perform "poll" and "upload" operations on a specified 
**   attached container. Also available are the "PRAGMA bcv_poll"
**   and "PRAGMA bcv_upload" SQL commands.
**
**   Poll operations: When a container is first attached, its "manifest" file
**   is downloaded from cloud storage. The manifest file contains the list
**   of databases in the container and the list of immutable blocks that
**   each database consists of. By default, this manifest is used until the
**   container is detached, only being updated according to local "upload"
**   operations (see below). A "poll" operation downloads a new copy of the
**   manifest from cloud storage, making any changes to the list of
**   available databases and their contents visible to local clients.
**
**   Upload operations: After a database has been modified locally, using the
**   usual SQLite interfaces (i.e. SQL statements), the changes may be uploaded
**   to cloud storage. An "upload" operation uploads all locally modified
**   databases that are part of the specified container.
**
**   When databases modifications are uploaded, or databases are deleted
**   from cloud storage containers altogether, old, unused blocks are left 
**   in cloud storage. The system allows these blocks to linger in case 
**   other clients are still using them instead of deleting them immediately.
**   To actually delete old, unused, blocks from cloud storage, see the
**   sqlite3_bcv_cleanup() API (in bcvutil.h).
**
** VIRTUAL TABLE INTERFACE
**
**   The sqlite3_bcvfs_register_vtab() API is used to register four read-only 
**   eponymous virtual tables, "bcv_database", "bcv_container", "bcv_block",
**   and "bcv_http_log", and one read-write table, "bcv_kv". If the main
**   database of the database handle that these are registered with is open on
**   a CBS database, the four read-only tables provide information regarding 
**   the current state of the VFS object. The "bcv_kv" table provides 
**   read-write access to a key-value store stored in the cloud container 
**   that may be useful for advisory locks or other communication between 
**   remote database clients.
**
**   The four read-only virtual tables are available to both daemon and
**   daemonless mode VFS clients, but bcv_kv is only available in daemonless 
**   mode.
**
** The bcv_container table:
**
**   The "bcv_container" table contains one row for each container attached
**   to the VFS. It has the equivalent of the following schema:
**
**     CREATE TABLE bcv_container(
**       name      TEXT,          -- local name (alias) of container 
**       storage   TEXT,          -- cloud storage system (e.g. "azure")
**       user      TEXT,          -- cloud storage username
**       container TEXT,          -- container name in cloud storage
**       ncleanup  INTEGER        -- number of blocks eligible for cleanup
**     )
**
**   The "ncleanup" column usually contains the number of blocks that will 
**   be deleted from cloud storage if a cleanup operation (see the 
**   sqlite3_bcv_cleanup() API)is run on the container. However, if
**   errors or client crashes have occurred while uploading changes to
**   cloud storage, then there may be extra unused blocks left in the
**   cloud storage container. In this case those blocks will be deleted
**   by the next cleanup operation, but are not included in the value
**   stored in the "ncleanup" column of the "bcv_container" table.
**
** The bcv_database table:
**
**   The "bcv_database" table contains one row for each database in each
**   attached container. It has the equivalent of the following schema:
**
**     CREATE TABLE bcv_database(
**       container TEXT,          -- local name (alias) of container
**       database  TEXT,          -- name of database
**       nblock INTEGER,          -- total number of blocks in database
**       ncache INTEGER,          -- number of blocks in cache
**       ndirty INTEGER,          -- number of dirty blocks in cache
**       walfile BOOLEAN,         -- true if transactions in local wal file
**       state TEXT               -- state of database (see below)
**     )
**
**   The "state" column usually contains an empty string. There are two
**   exceptions:
** 
**      * If the database has been created using sqlite3_bcvfs_copy() but
**        not yet uploaded, then this column contains the text 'copied'.
**
**      * If the database has been deleted using sqlite3_bcvfs_delete() but
**        the delete operation has not yet uploaded, then this column contains 
**        the text 'deleted'.
**
** The bcv_block table:
**
**   The "bcv_block" table contains one row for each block in each database 
**   in each attached container. It has the equivalent of the following 
**   schema:
**
**     CREATE TABLE bcv_block(
**       container TEXT,          -- local name (alias) of container
**       database  TEXT,          -- name of database
**       blockno   INTEGER,       -- block number within database
**       blockid   BLOB,          -- block id (or NULL)
**       cache     BOOLEAN,       -- true if block is in cache
**       dirty     BOOLEAN        -- true if block is dirty
**     ) 
**
**   The first three columns, "container", "database" and "blockno", identify
**   a block within a specific database. Blocks are numbered starting from
**   zero.
**
**   The "blockid" column usually contains a unique block identifier. Or, if
**   the block in question has been appended to the database since it was
**   last uploaded, this column contains a NULL value. The boolean "cache"
**   column is true if the block is currently cached locally, and "dirty"
**   is true if the block is dirty and a new version needs to be uploaded.
**
** The bcv_http_log table:
**
**   The "bcv_http_log" table contains one row for each HTTP request made
**   by the VFS or connected daemon. It has the equivalent of the following
**   for a schema:
**
**     CREATE TABLE bcv_http_log(
**       id INTEGER,              -- Unique, monotonically increasing id value
**       start_time INTEGER,      -- Time request was made, as iso-8601
**       end_time INTEGER,        -- Time reply received, as iso-8601 (or NULL)
**       method TEXT,             -- "PUT", "GET" etc.
**       client TEXT,             -- Name of client that caused request
**       logmsg TEXT,             -- Log message associated with request
**       uri TEXT,                -- URI of request
**       httpcode INTEGER         -- HTTP response code (e.g. 200)
**     ) 
**
**   For those requests that can be associated with a single SQLite database
**   handle, the contents of the "client" column is the client name as
**   configured using the "PRAGMA bcv_client" command. For requests associated
**   with a prefetch operation, it contains the string 'prefetch'.
**
**   To prevent it from consuming an ever-increasing amount of memory, entries 
**   are automatically removed from the bcv_http_log on a first-in/first-out
**   according to the values configured for the SQLITE_BCV_HTTPLOG_TIMEOUT 
**   and SQLITE_BCV_HTTPLOG_NENTRY parameters. Or, in daemon mode, according
**   to the values passed via the --httplogtimeout and --httplognentry 
**   command-line options.
**
**   Including various overheads, each entry may be assumed to consume 
**   256 bytes of memory or less. So allowing 4096 entries to accumulate in
**   the bcv_http_log table may require up to 1MiB of memory.
**
** The bcv_kv table:
**
**   The schema of the "bcv_kv" table is:
**
**     CREATE TABLE bcv_kv(
**       name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,   -- Key value 
**       value                    -- Associated payload value
**     )
**
**   The contents of the bcv_kv table is stored as a separate file (an
**   SQLite database) in the cloud container - "bcv_kv.bcv". The table
**   is empty when the container is first created.
**
**   The bcv_kv table implements transaction-like properties. As follows:
**
**     * The first time in a database transaction that the bcv_kv table 
**       is read or written, the file is downloaded from cloud storage and
**       cached for the duration of the transaction. All user queries -
**       read and write - are executed against this cached version of the 
**       bcv_kv table. This ensures that each transaction sees a consistent 
**       version of the table contents.
**
**     * When a read/write transaction is committed, a new version of the
**       bcv_kv table data is uploaded to cloud storage. At this point,
**       if it is found that the file has been modified within cloud storage
**       since it was downloaded at the beginning of the transaction (because
**       some other client wrote to it), the commit fails and the transaction
**       is rolled back. The extended error code in this case is 
**       SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT.
**
** Virtual tables without a database:
**
**   Sometimes, it may be convenient to access the virtual table interface
**   without having to identify and open a cloud container database. To
**   support this, paths of the forms:
**
**      /
**      /CONTAINER
**
**   may be opened with bcvfs VFSs, where CONTAINER is the local name (alias)
**   of an attached container. The databases opened by either of these two
**   forms of path are empty. Attempting to create any new tables within them
**   fails. However, if sqlite3_bcvfs_register_vtab() is called on the
**   database handle, they may be used to access the bcvfs virtual table
**   interface.
**
**   If the path opened is simply "/", then only the "bcv_database" and
**   "bcv_container" tables are available. If the path is of the form
**   "/CONTAINER", then all three virtual tables are available.

**     will fail.
**
**   * if another client manipulates the parent database in such a way
**     as to make blocks that the local-only database depends on eligible
