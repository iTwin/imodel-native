/*
** CAPI: Create a New Zipvfs VFS - zipvfs_create_vfs()
**
** These functions create a new zipvfs VFS and register it with SQLite. 
** The zipvfs_create_vfs_v3() interface is recommended for all new
** applications.  The zipvfs_create_vfs() and zipvfs_create_vfs_v2()
** interfaces are retained for backwards compatibility but their use
** is discouraged.
**
** The name of the new VFS is as specified by parameter zName.
** The new VFS accesses the file system using the existing VFS named
** by parameter zParent.
**
** The third argument to this function, pCtx, is a context pointer for the
** callback functions specified by the fourth, fifth and sixth arguments.
** Each time one of the callback functions is invoked, a copy of pCtx is
** passed to it as the first argument.
**
** The fourth, fifth and sixth arguments to this function - xCompressBound,
** xCompress and xUncompress, respectively - must be passed pointers to 
** functions that implement the compression/decompression operations used
** to compress and decompress database pages. Specifically:
**
**   xCompressBound:
**     This function should return the maximum possible size in bytes of the 
**     output produced by compressing a buffer of N bytes using the xCompress() 
**     method, where N is the value of the second argument passed to this 
**     callback.
**
**   xCompress:
**     This function is used to compress a page. The input data is stored
**     in the buffer described by the 4th and 5th arguments (aSrc and nSrc)
**     passed to this function. Output is written to the buffer pointed to by 
**     the second argument passed to this function (aDest). When this function
**     is called, the third argument (pnDest) points to a value of type int
**     containing the size of the output buffer. Before returning, this
**     callback should set *pnDest to the number of bytes written to the output
**     buffer - the size of the compressed data.
**     
**   xUncompress:
**     This function is used to uncompress a page previously compressed using
**     xCompress. The compressed page image is passed to the function via
**     the 4th and 5th arguments (aSrc and nSrc). The uncompressed output
**     should be written by this callback to the buffer pointed to by the
**     second argument (aDest). When this function is called, the third 
**     argument (pnDest) points to a value of type int containing the size
**     of the output buffer. Before returning, this callback should set 
**     *pnDest to the number of bytes written to the output buffer - the 
**     size of the uncompressed data.
**
** If VFS zParent does not exist, then this function returns SQLITE_ERROR and
** no new zipvfs VFS is created or registered. If an out-of-memory error is
** encountered while allocating space for the new VFS, SQLITE_NOMEM is 
** returned (and no new zipvfs VFS created or registered). Otherwise, SQLITE_OK
** is returned and the new VFS is both created and registered.
**
** The new VFS is not registered as the default. To make it the default, first
** create the VFS using this function. Then use code similar to the following
** to re-register the VFS, this time as the default:
**
**    sqlite3_vfs_register(sqlite3_vfs_find(zName), 1);
**
** The zipvfs_create_vfs_v2() interface works like zipvfs_create_vfs() while
** providing two additional callback functions:
**
**   xCompressOpen:
**     This routine is called once when a ZIPVFS database file is opened.
**     The first parameter is a copy of the context pointer, pCtx, that was
**     given as the 3rd parameter to zipvfs_create_vfs_v2(). The
**     second argument is the name of the database file being opened.
**     If URI filenames are being used, the second argument can be used
**     with the sqlite3_uri_parameter() interface to extract additional
**     URI parameters. This feature might be used, for example, to pass
**     the password for encrypting or decrypting the database file to a set
**     of compression routines that also implement encryption. A new pCtx 
**     pointer is returned via the 3rd argument. The new pCtx pointer becomes 
**     the first parameter to the xCompressBound, xCompress, xUncompress 
**     and xCompressClose methods in place of the pCtx pointer supplied 
**     directly to zipvfs_create_vfs_v2().
**
**   xCompressClose:
**     This routine is called when a ZIPVFS database connection is closed.
**     It provides an opportunity to deallocate resources allocated by
**     xCompressOpen.  
**
** If the xCompressOpen and xCompressClose parameters are NULL then the
** zipvfs_create_vfs_v2() interface works exactly like
** zipvfs_create_vfs().
**
** The zipvfs_create_vfs_v3() method is a slightly different alternative to
** the previous two create_vfs methods. In this case, instead of supplying
** callbacks directly, the user supplies a factory method - xAutoDetect. The
** first time each file opened with the created VFS is read, the xAutoDetect
** callback is invoked. The fourth argument passed to the xAutoDetect callback
** is a pointer to a structure of type ZipvfsMethods. Initially, all fields
** of this structure are set to zero. If the xAutoDetect method leaves them
** this way, SQLite attempts to open the database file as an ordinary, 
** uncompressed database. Or, the xAutoDetect implementation may populate 
** the fields of the ZipvfsMethods structure with pointers to the methods
** that will be used to compress and uncompress the database.
** 
** If no error occurs, the xAutoDetect implementation should return SQLITE_OK.
** Otherwise, it may return any SQLite error code and the error will be
** propagated back to the user.
**
** The first argument passed to the xAutoDetect invocation is a copy of the 3rd
** argument passed to zipvfs_create_vfs3(). The second argument is passed a
** pointer to a buffer containing the database file name. This is a copy
** of the pointer passed to the created VFS's xOpen method, and so the
** sqlite3_uri_parameter() function may be used with it to extract any URI
** parameters specified by the SQLite user. If a new database is being 
** created, the third argument to xAutoDetect is passed a NULL. Otherwise, it
** is passed a pointer to a buffer containing a copy of the 13 byte database 
** header string identifying the compression algorithm used by the database.
** The implementation of xAutoDetect should interpret this string and provide
** compatible compression routines via the ZipvfsMethods output structure
** (see below).

** CAPI: Container for Callback Pointers - struct ZipvfsMethods
**
** A pointer to an instance of this structure is passed to the xAutoDetect
** factory method invoked by Zipvfs VFS's created using 
** zipvfs_create_vfs_v3(). Initially, the fields of the structure are zero.
** If they are not modified by the xAutoDetect implementation SQLite treats

**
** The pCtx, xCompressBound, xCompress, xUncompress and xCompressClose 
** fields are all identical to the correspondingly named arguments to the
** zipvfs_create_vfs_v2() function.
**
** The zHdr field should be set to point to a nul-terminated string. If the
** string is longer than 13 bytes, not including the nul-terminator, it is
** truncated. If a new database is created, the string that zHdr points to
** is written into the header file of the new database. This string will 
** then be read from the database and passed as the third parameter to
** the xAutoDetect() invocation next time it is opened. It follows that the 
** first 13 bytes of the string that zHdr points to should identify the
** compression functions that the other fields are set to, so that future
** invocations of xAutoDetect can supply Zipvfs with compatible functions.
**
** The zAuxHdr field, if not NULL, is a zero-terminated string that is
** appended after the zero-terminator on zHdr, assuming there is space.

/*
** CAPI: File-control Operations Supported by Zipvfs
**
** Values interpreted by the xFileControl method of a zipvfs db file-handle.
**
** ZIPVFS_CTRL_COMPACT:
**   This control is used to compact a database (rebuild it with zero 
**   free-slots and zero fragmented bytes). The argument may either be
**   NULL, or a pointer to a variable of type sqlite3_int64.
**
**   If the argument is a NULL, then zipvfs attempts to compact the 
**   database. If successful, SQLITE_OK is returned and the database 
**   file truncated before returning. For small database files, this is
**   fine. For larger database files it has two disadvantages: (1) 
**   It may take a long time, during which time an exclusive lock is held
**   on the database preventing other processes from accessing it, 
**   and (2) a journal file as large as the database itself may be 
**   created during the compact operation (it is deleted before the 
**   call returns, but may still be a problem if disk space is scarce).
**
**   If the argument is a pointer to a variable of type sqlite3_int64,
**   then only a section of the database is compacted before returning.
**   Subsequent ZIPVFS_CTRL_COMPACT operations continue on from where the
**   previous one finished. The initial value of the sqlite3_int64 variable 
**   is used as a rough limit to the size of the section of the database
**   compacted (and therefore a rough limit on the size of the journal file
**   created during the partial compact). If this limit is less than the
**   total size of the database file, then multiple calls may be required to
**   compact the file. If the limit is zero or less than zero, then the 
**   entire file is compacted. The file is not truncated until the entire 
**   database has been compacted.
**
**   Before returning, the value of the sqlite3_int64 variable pointed to by
**   the file-control argument is set to the number of bytes in the part of
**   the database file yet to be compacted. If the file has been completely
**   compacted, zipvfs sets the value to 0.
**
** ZIPVFS_CTRL_OFFSET_AND_SIZE
**   The argument is a pointer to an array of two sqlite3_int64 values.  
**   The first element of the array holds a page number when called.  The
**   first element is overwritten with the offset from the beginning of the
**   compressed file to where the page is stored.  The second element of the
**   array is overwritten with the size of the page as stored in the compressed
**   database files.
**
** ZIPVFS_CTRL_MAXFREE:
**   The argument to this file-control is a pointer to a variable of type
**   "int". It is used to set a limit on the number of free-slots allowed
**   to accumulate within the zipvfs file before zipvfs becomes more 
**   aggressive in its attempts to reuse them. 
**
**   When there are less free-slots in the file than the configured limit, a 
**   free-slot is only reused if it is the exact size required by a new 
**   compressed page image. Once the configured limit is reached or exceeded,
**   when a new compressed page record is written to the file a free-slot is
**   reused if there exists one large enough that is not more than MAXFRAG
**   bytes larger than required, where MAXFRAG is the limit configured by the
**   ZIPVFS_CTRL_MAXFRAG file-control. If there is more than one free-slot 
**   that fits these constraints, the smallest is used.
**
** ZIPVFS_CTRL_MAXFRAG:
**   This file control is used to set a limit on the maximum amount of space
**   that will be wasted when reusing a free-slot for a new record (see 
**   ZIPVFS_CTRL_MAXFREE for details). The argument to this file-control
**   should be a pointer to a variable of type "int" that contains the new
**   limit value.
**
** ZIPVFS_CTRL_CACHESIZE:
**   Set the size of the page-cache used by the VFS when writing to the 
**   database file. The argument should be a pointer to a value of type int.
**
** ZIPVFS_CTRL_INTEGRITY_CHECK:
**   Check that a zipvfs database file appears to be internally consistent.
**   This is not the same as running "PRAGMA integrity_check".
**
** ZIPVFS_CTRL_LOCKING_MODE:
**   This file-control is similar to the "PRAGMA locking_mode" command 
**   supported by SQLite. The argument should be a pointer to a value of
**   type "int". If the value is initially set to 0, then an attempt is
**   made to set the pager used to write to the zipvfs file to 
**   locking_mode=normal mode. If the value is initially 1, then an attempt
**   is made to set it to locking_mode=exclusive. Other values do not modify
**   the locking-mode of the pager, but may be used to query for the same.
**
**   Before returning, the value of the int variable pointed to by the
**   argument is set to 0 if the pager is left in locking_mode=normal mode,
**   or 1 if the pager is left in locking_mode=exclusive mode.
**
** ZIPVFS_CTRL_STAT:
**   The argument to this file-control must be a pointer to an instance
**   of struct ZipvfsStat (see below). If successful, the fields of the
**   structure are populated according to the current size and structure
**   of the zipvfs database file before returning SQLITE_OK. If an error
**   is encountered while attempting to read the database file, an error
**   code is returned and the final values of the structure fields are 
**   undefined.
**
** ZIPVFS_CTRL_CACHE_USED:
**   The argument must be a pointer to an integer of type sqlite3_int64.
**   Before returning, this file-control sets the value of the output
**   integer to the number of bytes of memory used by the underlying 
**   zipvfs pager (the same value as is returned by DBSTATUS_CACHE_USED
**   for a top level pager). 
**
** ZIPVFS_CTRL_CACHE_HIT:
**   The argument must be a pointer to an integer of type sqlite3_int64.
**   Before returning, this file-control sets the value of the output
**   integer to the number of cache hits that have occurred since the
**   counter was reset (the same value as is returned by DBSTATUS_CACHE_HITS
**   for a top level pager). If the value of the output integer is initially
**   non-zero, the counter is reset before returning.
**
** ZIPVFS_CTRL_CACHE_MISS:
**   As for ZIPVFS_CTRL_CACHE_HIT, except for DBSTATUS_CACHE_MISS.
**
** ZIPVFS_CTRL_CACHE_WRITE:
**   As for ZIPVFS_CTRL_CACHE_HIT, except for DBSTATUS_CACHE_WRITE.
**
** ZIPVFS_CTRL_DIRECT_READ:
**   The argument must be a pointer to an integer of type sqlite3_int64.
**   Before returning, this file-control sets the value of the output
**   integer to the number of read operations performed by zipvfs directly
**   on the underlying database file (bypassing the zipvfs pager). If the 
**   value of the output integer is initially non-zero, the counter is 
**   reset before returning.
**
** ZIPVFS_CTRL_DIRECT_BYTES:
**   As for ZIPVFS_CTRL_CACHE_HIT, except the output value is the total
**   number of bytes read directly, not the number of xRead calls.
