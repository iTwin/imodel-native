* Sets this instance to a matrix which is the inverse of in
* IN THE SPECIAL CASE WHERE in HAS ONLY PURE ROTATION OR
* MIRRORING IN ITS ROTATIONAL PART.   These special conditions allow
* the 'inversion' to be done by only a transposition and one
* matrix-times-point multiplication, rather than the full effort of
* inverting a general transformation. It is the caller's responsibility
* to be sure that these special conditions hold.  This usually occurs
* when the caller has just constructed the transform by a sequence of
* translations and rotations.
* If the caller has received the matrix from nonverified external
* sources and therefore does not know if the special conditions apply,
* the <CODE>inverseOf</CODE> method should be used instead.
* in may be the same as this instance.
* The specific computations in this special-case inversion are (1) the
* output transform's translation is the input transform's
* matrix times the negative of the input transform's translation, and (2) the
* output transform's matrix part is the tranpose of the input transform's
* matrix part.
* Symbolically, given transform [R t] return transform [R^ (R^)*(-t)]
* where ^ indicates transposition.
