/**
@page BentleyGeom_Summary_CurveVector CurveVector

A CurveVector is a collection of curve primitives.

This can represent paths, loops, multi-loop parity regions, and multi-region collections.

A CurveVector is a refcounted structure. At point of creation, a curve vector is addressed via a CurveVectorPtr.
Inputs to methods can be passed as simple references and pointers.

<h3>Example tree structures for CurveVector</h3>
<ul>
<li> open chain:
<pre>
    (CurveVector::BOUNDARY_TYPE_OPEN prim1 prim2 ... primN)
</pre>

<li> single loop:
<pre>
   (CurveVector::BOUNDARY_TYPE_OUTER prim1 prim2 ... primN)
</pre>

<li> multi-loop region:
<pre>
 (CurveVector::BOUNDARY_TYPE_UNION_REGION
    (CurveVector::BOUNDARY_TYPE_OUTER prim1 ... primN)
    (CurveVector::BOUNDARY_TYPE_OUTER prim1 ... primN)
    (CurveVector::BOUNDARY_TYPE_INNER prim1 ... primN)
    )
</pre>

<li> union of regions:
<pre>
    (CurveVector::BOUNDARY_TYPE_UNION_REGION  // the direct children of this CurveVector may be any set of Outer and ParityReigion
        (CurveVector:ParityRegion
            (CurveVector::BOUNDARY_TYPE_OUTER prim1 ... primN)
            (CurveVector::BOUNDARY_TYPE_OUTER prim1 ... primN)
            (CurveVector::BOUNDARY_TYPE_INNER prim1 ... primN)
            )
        (CurveVector::BOUNDARY_TYPE_OUTER prim1 prim2 ... primN)
        )
</pre>
</ul>

<h3>Parity Regions</h3>
A parity region is a collection of unordered loops. A point moving in the plane transitions from "in" to "out"
(or vice versa) any time it crosses a curve.

This definition of inside and outside is well defined even if (a) the loops cross each other, (b) self-intersection
within a loop, (c) any order of presentation of the loops.

In the usual case where there is a single outer loop and one or more hole loops, it is customary to store the outer
loop first followed by holes, with the outer loop counterclockwise and inner loops clockwise.

Warning: Computational code that requires signed loops (e.g. area calculations) assumes that the largest loop is outer
and others are inner.
