BEGIN_BENTLEY_GEOMETRY_NAMESPACE

/**
@brief MSBsplineCurve is a "Non uniform, rational Bspline curve".

<h3>Pole and knot counts</h3>

<TABLE BORDER="1">
<TR><TD>Open curve</TD> <TD>knots = poles + order</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Closed (periodc) curve</TD> <TD>knots = poles + 2 * order - 1</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<h3>Parametric position along a bspline curve</h3>

There are two conventions for identifying positions within the splines parameter space:
<TABLE BORDER="1">
<TR><TD>Convention</TD><TD>start value  </TD><TD> end value    </TD><TD> remarks  </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Fraction position    </TD><TD> always 0.0  </TD><TD> always 1.0    </TD><TD> this is the easiest (prefered) way for any app that is not directly manipulating the knot vector. </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Knot postion </TD><TD> first active knot value </TD><TD> last active knot value    </TD><TD> "active" knots are the "mid section" knots ignoring (order-1) leading and trailing knots </TD></TR>
</TABLE>

The word Fraction or Knot in a method name indicates how the arguments for that method are interpreted.

<h3>Clamping convention</h3>
Open knot vectors follow the "clamping convention":
<ul>
<li>The first (order) knots are identical and are the start value for the knot range.
<li>The last (order) knots are identical and are the final value for the knot range.
<li>Older code assumes clamping.
<li>Recent code does not assume clamping.
<li>No promises are made for behavior of unclamped knot vectors.
<li>Careful analysis of basis fucntion logic says that the very first and last knot values are never referenced in the basis function logic.  But this extra knot convention is widely used in interchange formats.
</ul>
