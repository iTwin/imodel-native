//! Decompose an (arbitrary) polygon into an XOR of simpler polygons.
//! Each output polygon will have a consistent turning direction, either CW or CCW as
//! indicated by the flag value.
//! If you have any reason to feel that the input polygon does not criss-cross itself,
//! "consistent turning direction" means it is convex.  If the input is not trusted, the
//! output may need to be inspected to check for cases where the polygon spirals "inward" then
//! outward so that it manages to cross over itself without having any changes in concavity.
//!
//! The output is an array of indices into the original points.
//! Each output polygon is described by a sequence of point indices, followed by
//! a negative index.   The negative index is  -1 for a CCW polygon, -2 for CW.

//! @param pIndexArray OUT     indices and flags
//! @param pNumIndex   OUT     number of ints in the index array.
//! @param maxIndex    IN      max number of indices (dimension of pIndexArray).  The recommended
//!                           value for this is twice the number of points.
//! @param pPointArray IN      point coordinates.  Only the xy coordiantes are used -- transform
