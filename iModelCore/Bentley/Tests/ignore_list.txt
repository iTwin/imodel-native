# This test case is working as expected and has been ignored temporarily. The issue is with the function BeStringUtilities::StricmpAscii.
# Once this behavior explained below is fixed, the test case can be removed from the ignore list.
# The Function BeStringUtilities::StricmpAscii converts all characters to lowercase before comparing them. This is causing a problem when one of the strings contains any of the following characters: [\]^_`
# These characters lie between the uppercase and lowercase characters in the ASCII table.
# Since the function StricmpAscii converts everything to lowercase, the alpha characters always end up greater than these special characters and the function always returns a positive value.
# This is not the expected behavior. When these special characters are compared with uppercase characters, the function should return a negative value.
