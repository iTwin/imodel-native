 @addtogroup Sprites
 Sprites are (typically) small raster images that are drawn "on top" of Viewports by an IViewDecoration.
 Their purpose is to draw the user's attention to something of importance.

 There are two classes in the Sprites subsystem: ISprite (a Sprite Definition) and SpriteLocation.
 Sprite Definitions are the images that define the way a type of sprite looks and are generally
 loaded one time and saved for the rest of a session. A SpriteLocation defines the current
 position of a single Sprite in a DgnViewport.

 A SpriteLocation can be either active or inactive. It becomes active by specifying a location
 (an x,y point) and a Sprite Definition to draw at that point. It should be obvious that a single Sprite
 Definition can be used many times by many Sprite Locations and that a single Sprite Location can
 change both position and which Sprite Definition is shown at that position over time.

 Sprites can be of varying sizes and color depths and can have both opaque and transparent pixels. 
 
 At a given time there can be many Sprites Locations shown in a DgnViewport. However, since the entire scene is
 refreshed from the backingStore for every frame (see discussion of Scene Creation in the detailed description of \ref DgnViewport), and
 since Sprites are NOT stored in the backingStore, every IViewDecoration must (re)draw all of its SpriteLocations for every frame
 or they will disappear.

 Element Manipulator handles and the Accusnap indicators are examples of  use of Sprites.
 @note It is also possible to draw an ISprite onto a DgnViewport directly (via calls to IViewDraw::DrawSprite)
 without ever using a SpritLocation. SpriteLocations are merely provided as a convenience.

 A Sprite Location. Sprites generally move around on the screen and this object holds the current location
 and current Sprite Definition for an image of a sprite within a DgnViewport. SpriteLocations can be either
 inactive (not visible) or active.
 <p>A SpriteLocation can also specify that a Sprite Definition should be drawn partially transparent so that
 you can "see through" the Sprite.
