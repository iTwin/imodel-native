//!    2. parallelized exchaustive search (or parallel brute force method);
//!    3. BVH-based search;
//!    4. BVH-based search with parallelized traverse routine;
//! - for vertices:
//!    1. non-parallel straighforward implementation (exchaustive search);
//!    2. parallelized exchaustive search (or parallel brute force method);
//!    3. parallelized search, based on sorting vertices using radix sort,
//!       combining sequences of vertices into patches with fixed size and
//!       sieving improper patches of points using overlap test between the
//!       cylinder and AABB of the patch.
//! The class also contains interface for choosing overlap detection method
//! and setting up the size of the patch.
