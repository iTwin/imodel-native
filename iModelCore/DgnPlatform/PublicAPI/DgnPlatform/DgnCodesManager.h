//=======================================================================================
//! The possible states in which an authority-issued code can exist.
//! The server is the ultimate authority on every code's state.
//!
//! A code can be in exactly one of four possible states:
//!     - Available: Any briefcase can reserve the code.
//!     - Reserved: a briefcase has reserved the code for use. No other briefcase may reserve or use it.
//!     - Used: A revision has been committed in which the code was assigned to an object. No briefcase may reserve or use it.
//!     - Discarded: A revision has been committed in which a previously-used code became disused.
//!       Any briefcase can reserve it, provided they have pulled the revision in which it became discarded.
//!
//! Possible transitions of code state:
//!     Available => Reserved: A code which has never previously been used becomes reserved by a briefcase.
//!     Reserved => Available: A reserved code which was never used is relinquished by the briefcase which reserved it.
//!     Reserved => Used: A briefcase committed a revision in which it assigned a reserved code to an obejct.
//!     Used => Discarded: A briefcase committed a revision in which the code became disused.
//!     Discarded => Reserved: A previously-used code was reserved for use by a briefcase.
//! Once a code is used, it remains tracked for the lifetime of a repository; therefore its state never returns to Available.
//!
//! In order to assign a code to an object, a briefcase must first reserve the code. This is verified when inserting and updating coded objects into the DgnDb.
//! If this verification fails, the operation will return DgnDbStatus::CodeNotReserved.
