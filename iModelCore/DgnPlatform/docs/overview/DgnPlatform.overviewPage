/** @page PAGE_DgnPlatform DgnPlatform Overview

The DgnPlatform library is a key part of the DgnDb technology stack from <a href="http://www.bentley.com/">Bentley</a>. 
The DgnPlatform library contains the data access API for the DgnDb file format.
It also provides the run-time services necessary for writing applications focused on sustaining infrastructure (buildings, bridges, transit, utilities, energy, water, etc.).
The technology stack is designed to leverage whatever system resources are available without strictly requiring them.
This allows applications to run on everything from mobile devices to high-powered desktop environments.
<p>
Key requirements addressed by the DgnPlatform library include:

@li Rich, first class support for geometry, graphics, and relational business data
@li Scalable for large scale infrastructure projects
@li Connected and disconnected operations
@li Cross platform
@li Standards based

The DgnDb technology stack starts with the DgnDb file format which is based on SQLite.  %Bentley has extended SQLite to support 
geometric queries in addition to the standard SQL relational database queries.  %Bentley has also added a way to store complex geometry
and graphics within the DgnDb file.  The DgnDb file format provides the foundation for persisting infrastructure data.
<p>
There are three primary layers to a DgnDb application:

@li The platform layer
@li The domain layer
@li The app layer

The DgnDb run-time comprises the platform layer and includes all of the services built into the DgnPlatform library.
<p>
A domain is an ECSchema (data model) and a C++ data-access library that is typically focused on an infrastructure discipline and/or lifecycle phases.  
Domain examples include:

@li Building Design
@li Civil Conceptual Design
@li Plant Operations
@li Construction
@li Planning

Domains ship with the platform but are separate in a software architecture sense.  The goal of a domain is to capture the data model and file I/O services
required for a specific discipline or lifecycle phase.  Domains are meant to be used across applications and to raise the level of information sharing.
Domains are written in C++ and do not include user interface or tools.

@ref DgnDomainGroup

<p>
Within a domain, real-world objects are modeled using elements and element aspects.  An element represents that identity and function of the real-world object.
Subclasses of DgnElement are created for each type of real-world object that is being modeled.  Elements focus on specification.  For example, a piece
of equipment that performs a specific function.
<p>
Element aspects are additional data instances associated with and owned by the element. Element aspects focus on the unique form and instance-specific properties of the real-world object
that fulfills the specification.  Standard element aspects like ElementItem (properties of the item ordered from a catalog) and ElementGeom (physical geometry of the element) may be used, 
or applications can introduce their own aspects.  This composition-based pattern of data modeling is very flexible and powerful.
<p>
Elements are the center of the DgnDb universe and are described in more detail here:

@li @subpage PAGE_ElementOverview

<p>
The final layer for a DgnDb application is the app layer.  The app decides which domains to include and provides the user interface and tools and everything that the user sees.
This layer is typically written in TypeScript/JavaScript.

The DgnPlatform library also adds other key concepts required by infrastructure applications.  These concepts include:
