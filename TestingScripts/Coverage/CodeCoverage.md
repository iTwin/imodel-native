# Code Coverage

## Development setup

### Steps to generate html report

- Change the build strategy in the env.bat file to iModelCoreCoverage

- Run `bb build` to generate the code coverage report for all the different components of iModelCore

- You can also generate the code coverage reports of a single component by specifing the part in the `bb` command. Follow `Coverage.PartFile.xml` for more details on indiviual parts.

- You can also generate xml reports with html reports just by providing the flag Type in `BentleyBuildMakeOptions` e.g.- `BentleyBuildMakeOptions="-dCOMP_Name=Bentley -dType=xml"`. See `Coverage.PartFile.xml` for more details.

### Steps to generate excel report

- Change the build strategy in the env.bat file to iModelCoreCoverage

- To generate excel report you will have to first define `generateExcel` in your shared shell everytime. e.g. set generateExcel=1.

- To generate excel report we also need a python package named `XlsxWriter`. The quick command to install it would be `pip install XlsxWriter`. For more details visit [here](https://pypi.org/project/XlsxWriter/)

- Run `bb build` to generate the code coverage report for all the different components of iModelCore

- You can also generate the code coverage reports of a single component by specifing the part in the `bb` command. Follow `Coverage.PartFile.xml` for more details on indiviual parts.

### Special Note

`LastCoverageResults.log` files might be generated when we run code coverage. These files give us an overview of the overall coverage. The most probable places of generation are at `srcRoot/imodel-native/TestingScripts/Coverage` or in the `srcRoot/imodel-native` or both. The name `LastCoverageResults.log` is gitignored so that we don't accidentally push them to git. Still it is advised when we run code coverage we also manually check before commiting to prevent accidental push.

### Note - TODO:

Currently the test coverage we get is for files and for the number of lines. We can also extend the behaviour so that we get coverage also for the number of methods. The logic for that is not yet implemented properly and needs looking into in subsequent time.

### Detailed explanation of Components.json file for future maintenance

The `Components.json` file contains a mapping between each individual component of imodel-native and their corresponding dlls,exes and other values.
The key is the component name.
The values are in themselves json objects which are explained as follows :- 
| Values    | Meaning                     |
| --------  | --------------------------  |
| dll       | dll Name                    |
| exe       | exe Name                    |
| product   | product Name                | 
| ignore    | path to ignore_list.txt. Each array element is a path string which are joined using os.path.join().(The base path for this is : ${SrcRoot}/imodel-native)     |
| pdb       | path to .pdb files. Each array element is a path string which are joined using os.path.join().(The base path for this is : ${OutRoot}/Winx64/build)           |
