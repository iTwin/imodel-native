        NOTE: The Following two Parts should ONLY be included directly from a Product, NEVER from another Part. That's because they bind
        two different files that have the same name (which is tricky and generally not a good idea). If they are included as a SubPart of
        another Part, they pollute the build context and can cause binding errors if they are somehow both referenced from the same PartFile.

        The choice of which to use must be made at the PRODUCT level only!!!
